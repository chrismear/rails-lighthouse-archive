      <body>This is DEFINITELY a Rails issue. My coworker just tried to do the same thing today. He has been developing with Rails for 2+ years, and we recently upgraded our install. Well, I upgraded it, and I'm on Linux. He can't, because he's on Windows. The two libraries Rails is requiring here, sqlite3-ruby and rmagick, shouldn't be necessary for a Rails install. We use MySQL, and we sure don't use any image process (let alone with RMagick *shudders*). I know they can be handy to have for getting up and running immediately for most basic Rails apps, but you should allow and  the options for not including those. All he did was &quot;gem install rails&quot;. C'mon, I hate Windows as much as the next guy, but there are valid reasons for needing to develop on it. The basic Rails install should work for all major platforms, don't you think? I can't imagine not requiring sqlite and rmagick are huge issues. And I think these are really the only parts that don't mesh with Windows.
