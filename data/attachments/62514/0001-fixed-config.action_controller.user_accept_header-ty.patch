 === Other Action Controller Changes
 
 * You can now easily link:http://m.onkey.org/2008/7/20/rescue-from-dispatching[show a custom error page] for exceptions raised while routing a request.
-* The HTTP Accept header is disabled by default now. You should prefer the use of formatted URLs (such as +/customers/1.xml+) to indicate the format that you want. If you need the Accept headers, you can turn them back on with +config.action_controller.user_accept_header = true+.

 * Benchmarking numbers are now reported in milliseconds rather than tiny fractions of seconds
 * Rails now supports HTTP-only cookies (and uses them for sessions), which help mitigate some cross-site scripting risks in newer browsers.
 * +redirect_to+ now fully supports URI schemes (so, for example, you can redirect to a svn+ssh: URI).
