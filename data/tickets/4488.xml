  <original-body>I've been experimenting with Rails 3.0.0.beta3. I first started with a few simple models and got a handle of some of changes. I could not get the rails upgrade plugin to work so I started from scratch and generated scaffolds on a nested model (assessments, questions, answers) and things seemed to be working fine after I figured out how to get my routing to work with the lack of :shallow =&gt; true. 

I was experimenting with new activeRecord queries in the index action for questions

@questions = Assessment.find(params[:assessment_id]).questions

and started to get a segmentation fault. I discovered that I forgot to put my relationships in the models. Putting them in still give me the segmentation fault. Most of the time, the server just locks up and I have to kill the server processess. I can go into rails console and get my finds to work, but not with WEBrick. Sometimes the server will abort. Enclosed is was what was on the server console the last time I got it to abort.

Can't seem to do anything and not sure what happened. Once I saw a postgres compiler error, but postgres is working find in the dbconsole. The attached dump is the most exhaustive I've seen. It starts off with:

      <body>Highly recommend switching to 1.9.2 (ruby trunk). Ruby 1.9.1 has had frustrating segfault issues in several stable releases, whereas 1.9.2 has been more stable overall.

We can't really fix this in Rails, either :)</body>
