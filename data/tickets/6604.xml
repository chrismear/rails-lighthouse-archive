  <original-body>ON my home network, I have a transparent proxy.  I am connecting to a rails server across the Internet.  I was surprised to see this in the logs:

Started GET &quot;/auction/login&quot; for 192.168.2.1 at 2011-03-22 07:59:12 -0500

192.168.2.1 is the IP address of my home network internal router.  Not my laptop, not my internal proxy... and most of all, not my public IP address.   To the admin of the server, the address makes absolutely no sense.  The server should only need to report the public ip!</original-body>
