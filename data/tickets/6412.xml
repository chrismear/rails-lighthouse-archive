  <original-body>Hello.
I found that method construct_finder_sql_with_included_associations(options, join_dependency) of Rails 2.3 is not optimal when called from find() method with :order, :include and :limit options. It adds unnecessary checks in WHERE clause after load IDs for limited eager loading.

If we have already found needed IDs during limited eager loading, we don't need additional checks in WHERE clause.

Example.
*Before patch*

      <body-html>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.&lt;br&gt;
I found that method
construct_finder_sql_with_included_associations(options,
join_dependency) of Rails 2.3 is not optimal when called from
find() method with :order, :include and :limit options. It adds
unnecessary checks in WHERE clause after load IDs for limited eager
loading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have already found needed IDs during limited eager
loading, we don't need additional checks in WHERE clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Before patch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education::Pc Load IDs For Limited Eager Loading (4.7ms)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;sql&quot;&gt;SELECT &lt;em&gt; FROM (SELECT DISTINCT ON (&quot;pcs&quot;.id) &quot;pcs&quot;.id, COALESCE(pcs.min_cost, pcs.max_cost) AS alias_0 FROM &quot;pcs&quot; WHERE ((SELECT COUNT(&lt;/em&gt;) FROM metro_stations_pcs c WHERE c.metro_station_id IN ('57') AND c.pc_id = pcs.id) &amp;gt; 0 AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pcs_durations c WHERE c.duration_id IN ('4') AND c.pc_id = pcs.id) &amp;gt; 0) ) AS id_list ORDER BY id_list.alias_0 LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0&lt;/code&gt;
