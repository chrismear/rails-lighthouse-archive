  <original-body>Hello,

I don't know if this will make any sense to you; but here goes. When I send an email and I get a response, more often than not, in the 'to:' is my email address. However, my email address also ends up in the 'from' column.The 'reply-from' address is nowhere to be found;so I don't have any address with which I can send my reply, as both of them have just my email address. What am I doing wrong here? Is there some set-up in my TOOL&gt;OPTIONS set-up incorrectly? The set-up in OPTIONS is pretty difficult to understand and it doesn't offer any 'to' or 'reply-from' choices.

This is critical because I just cannot answer my emails because there is no one I can send a reply to.

Please, please try to help me.

Thank you.

Blessings.
