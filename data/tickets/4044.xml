  <original-body>Hello Everybody,

I have found that Redmine(Ruby on Rails) project might be useful for our needs. Therefore,I have been trying to setup Redmine on my LocalHost(Xampp based) since last couple of days. But I really couldn't find any way to setup something on my Xampp which allows me to run Ruby on Rails project as like other PHP based projects.

I also made some little changes on my httpd.conf file as fellows ---
AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .asp .rb

Moreover, After finally setup basic configuration of Ruby on Rails, I am just having following error message---

Application error 

Rails application failed to start properly

And Inside the Apache Error Log report says ...

[Wed Feb 24 10:47:40 2010] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] (OS 3)The system can not find the path specified. : couldn't create child process: 720003: dispatch.cgi
[Wed Feb 24 10:47:40 2010] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] (OS 3)The system can not find the path specified. : couldn't spawn child process: C:/xampp/htdocs/redmine/public/dispatch.cgi

Please Help me out :(</original-body>

      <body>Hi,

1. as far as i can see, redmine ships with an &quot;dispatch.cgi.example&quot; &#8212; have you renamed it? I guess not...
2. dispatchers are not automatically created on project creation anymore. (see rails -h  for the -D option)
3. you already discovered the right place to ask: The redmine board :-)
