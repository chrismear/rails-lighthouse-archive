  <original-body>I found an issue with I18n and adding errors to base which I fixed. It tried to call the base method on the record, as the I18n-part thought it was a normal attribute. It checks now to see if it respons to the method/attribute before it tries to pass its value to I18n.

I also found that there were no tests yet, that specifically defined the ActiveModel::Errors API. So I wrote them as well.

I am willing to clean up the I18n stuff in errors, which could be a bit cleaner, if anyone thinks that is a good idea. At least take a stab at it (without killing it of course).</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
