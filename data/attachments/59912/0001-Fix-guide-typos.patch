 Yes indeed we seem to have found the problem. Pathname#cleanpath_aggressive is taking nearly a quarter our process time and  Pathname#chop_basename another 17%. From here I do a few more benchmarks to make sure that these processes are slowing down the other pages. They are so now I know what I must do. *If we can get rid of or shorten these processes we can make our pages run much quicker*. 
 
-Now both of these are main ruby processes so are goal right now is to find out what other process is calling them. Glancing at our Graph file I see that #cleanpath is calling #cleanpath_aggressive. #cleanpath is being called by String#gsub and from there some html template errors. But my page seems to be rendering fine. why would it be calling template errors. I'm decide to check my object flat file to see if I can find any more information.

 * Profile based on the question and variables. Key problems to avoid when designing this experiment are:
 	- Confounding: Test one thing at a time, keep everything the same so you don't poison the data with uncontrolled processes. 
 	- Cross Contamination: Make sure that runs from one test do not harm the other tests.
-	- Steady States: If you’re testing long running process. You must take the ramp up time and performance hit into your initial measurements.
-	- Sampling Error: Data should perform have a steady variance or range. If you get wild swings or sudden spikes, etc. then you must either account for the reason why or you have a sampling error.
