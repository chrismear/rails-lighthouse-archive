  <original-body>The new support for time zones in Rails 2.1 does not apply time columns, but only to datetime and timestamp columns. I think this should be changed so that time columns undergo the same time zone conversions as datetime and timestamp columns.

The reasoning behind this is the same as for datetime and timestamp, even though time columns do not include date information: all times need to appear in the user's time zone. An example of where this would be important could be a news application that requires the submission of all prospective news items for the next day by a certain time, which is stored in the database. This time, even though it is date agnostic, still needs to appear in the user's own time zone to be understood correctly.

The attached patch adds time columns to the array of valid column types in the ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::ClassMethods.create_time_zone_conversion_attribute? method.</original-body>

      <body>I'm not sure I agree on this one. When only time, and not date is being persisted in the database, part of the information required to make an intelligent decision about conversion is missing. Namely, the ability to discern whether the time is during daylight savings time or not.

You could say the assumption should be made that the current date should be used for determining offset from UTC, but at that point, I'd contend you're not really dealing with a persisted attribute of the model at all, but instead a derived value from the persisted data. That makes a pretty strong case for you to do your own conversion if that's what you want.

I'd have to give this one a -1.</body>

      <body>To do time zone conversions, you need to work with specific points in time, and in order to convert a db time identifier like &quot;12:30:00&quot; to a specific point in time, you'd need to make an assumption about a date and a zone.

I'm in agreement with Ernie here, these assumptions sound like they belong in application code, not Rails.

Also, I'm not sure your example gives a compelling use case for time-only columns -- couldn't &quot;next day by a certain time&quot; be turned into a specific UTC time point, and stored in the db in a datetime column?</body>

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as their   handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that don't have   this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to style and   pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold loafers to slingbacks   with open toes. You may be able to find Coach shoes at discount prices online,   but be sure that you are buying genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous, Coach   shoes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chanelpursesbags.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chanel purses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can do that well. Coach sneakers and heels will make you   feel sporty, too. When selecting pumps or sandals to wear, you'll be happy to   count on the long-standing quality and service of the Coach company. They have   many styles to choose from, including chic and glamorous Coach boots and Coach   heels. Whether you are looking for sports shoes like Coach sneakers or sexy   shoes like Coach boots, the Coach name will never let you down.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
