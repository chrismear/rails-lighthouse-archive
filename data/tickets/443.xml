  <original-body>I have a constant PLATFORM_INTERFACE assigned in my environment.rb.  This constant references a module that is included in many other models throughout my app.  (It is a constant as the module varies depending on the platform the app is running on)

For example, my application controller has the line:

include PLATFORM_INTERFACE

Prior to 2.1, this worked fine.  However, as of 2.1 it throws an uninitialized constant error whenever it is included in a class: for example 
'uninitialized constant ApplicationController::PLATFORM_INTERFACE'

So it appears that constant that is assigned in environment.rb is not available when the application controller (as well as all other controllers and models) are loaded.  There was no mention of a change in the load order for 2.1, so I am going to assume it is a bug.</original-body>

      <body>So after more investigation, it turns out the problem only occurs in plugins as long as you preface the constant with :: (The :: was not necessary pre-2.1.0)  The error still occurs when a plugin tries to reference the constant, whether prefixed with :: or not.

A workaround is to use .send :include in the environment.rb.</body>
