  <original-body>Classic movie fans might remember the scenes in the film &#8220;Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s,&#8221; in which Audrey Hepburn stares longingly at the diamonds and jewels in the window of the iconic Tiffany &amp; Co. jeweler.

And on Friday, Dec. 10, those windows will come to Jacksonville for the first time as Tiffany &amp; Co. opens a new 3,500-square-foot store at the St. Johns Town Center.

With the jewelry and other merchandise comes the store&#8217;s signature turquoise gift boxes tied with white ribbon. But there&#8217;s much more to it than that: its brand has built a reputation and prestige that perhaps is unparalleled by any other U.S. retail brand.

Although exclusive Tiffany jewelry designs shape the store&#8217;s most famous wares, today it offers more, store director Kyle Wilkinson said. Tiffany exclusivity has been extended to watches, silverware, china, crystal, stationery, fragrances and accessories. As of July, according to its second-quarter results statement, the company operated 223 Tiffany &amp; Co. stores and boutiques. It had 91 in North and South America, 57 in Japan, 48 in Asia and the Pacific Rim and 27 in Europe, and had grown internationally by 12 stores since the second quarter of 2009.

The St. Johns Town Center Tiffany will make its home toward the south end of River City Drive, located between Louis Vuitton and Mayor&#8217;s Jewelers. The nearest other Tiffany &amp; Co. stores are in Orlando and Atlanta, and Wilkinson said the number of Jacksonville-area customers shopping at the Tiffany &amp; Co. stores in those cities and on the tiffany.com website supported opening a store here.

&#8220;It&#8217;s just waiting for the right spot, the perfect situation and the construction,&#8221; Wilkinson said. &#8220;That spot made itself available, and we were on it. We definitely think there is a demand in Jacksonville.&#8221;
