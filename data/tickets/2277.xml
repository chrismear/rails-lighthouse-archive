  <original-body>If a template, or nested templates, has both a call to content_tag_for Xobject and a call to form_for Xobject then these will both set the default css#id to xobject_(xobject.id) or to id=&quot;new_xobject&quot;.  This violates the xhtml rule relating to id which state that an id must be unique in a single page.

This can be worked around by specifying an id prefix in either or both of: content_tag_for and form_for but it seems that the default behaviour should be such as to avoid such collisions.

My suggestion is that the default behaviour, at least for form_for which is likely the more important element for css purposes, be extended to include a method identifier in the id. In that case form_for Xobject might produce id=&quot;new_xobject_form&quot; or id=&quot;xobject_idvalue_form&quot;.</original-body>
