  <original-body>In ActiveRecord 2.3.2, nested scopes (named or dynamic) that have conditions hashes with common keys get overwritten by the final scope.  For instance suppose there is a Widget model with id and name fields. Then

@@@ ruby
Widget.scoped_by_id([1,2,3]).scoped_by_name('foo').all
@@@

will return the widgets where the id is in [1,2,3] AND the name is 'foo'.  One would then expect that

@@@ ruby
Widget.scoped_by_id([1,2,3]).scoped_by_id([3,4,5]).all
@@@

would return only the widget with id=3 (using AND), but in fact the id condition of the second scope clobbers the first and we get any widgets matching [3,4,5].


This behavior is a change from previous versions of ActiveRecord and seems to be an intentional result of this checkin:

http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/fe6ffce51dc16285094be49244b26591956c2dd6

To my mind this breaks the semantics of a scope for finding, which should be a way to restrict results and should be arbitrarily chainable.</original-body>

      <body>As background, I came across this issue while upgrading a 2.1 rails app that uses nested find scopes to implement some user access control.  Basically it uses named scopes like

@@@ ruby
Asset.filter_by_user_access(some_user).filter_by_search_terms(some_term)
@@@

In this case, the search scope clobbered the access scope since they both relied on some of the same fields.</body>

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as their   handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that don't have   this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to style and   pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold loafers to slingbacks   with open toes. You may be able to find Coach shoes at discount prices online,   but be sure that you are buying genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous, Coach   shoes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chanelpursesbags.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chanel purses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can do that well. Coach sneakers and heels will make you   feel sporty, too. When selecting pumps or sandals to wear, you'll be happy to   count on the long-standing quality and service of the Coach company. They have   many styles to choose from, including chic and glamorous Coach boots and Coach   heels. Whether you are looking for sports shoes like Coach sneakers or sexy   shoes like Coach boots, the Coach name will never let you down.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

      <body>This issue seems to be fixed in Rails 3.0.5, but it is still a problem with older version of Rails 3 and *every* version of Rails 2. A long writeup on the issue can be found here: http://makandra.com/notes/740-know-the-side-effects-of-using-hashes-for-conditions

This should be fixed for Rails 2 because every application that uses scopes to restrict user access might be broken.

I could provide a patch that fixes this for the `2-3-stable` branch. Given that Rails 3 is the hot new thing now, would my fix still be considered for a future release?</body>
