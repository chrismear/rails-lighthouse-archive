  <original-body>I'm getting a strange case where saving an object that has a has_many/through does a double-SQL-insert on the join table. Unforunately, I can't get it to happen with a simple example (yet).

The left side of the relationshp is new. The right side is either new or not; doesn't seem to matter. The join table has a unique constraint, so an SQL error is thrown.

It runs the validations, the saves, and the after saves ... then it seems to run something again. This doesn't happen in the simple case, so in that case, it works. It looks from the stack trace like it's trying to run update on something (?) and thinks something is new still, a la @new_record_before_save in autosave_association.

Here's the stacktrace against 2-3-stable, but it happens against master and 2-2-stable as well.

      <body>I'm getting a strange case where saving an object that has a has_many/through does a double-SQL-insert on the join table. Unforunately, I can't get it to happen with a simple example (yet).

The left side of the relationshp is new. The right side is either new or not; doesn't seem to matter. The join table has a unique constraint, so an SQL error is thrown.

It runs the validations, the saves, and the after saves ... then it seems to run something again. This doesn't happen in the simple case, so in that case, it works. It looks from the stack trace like it's trying to run update on something (?) and thinks something is new still, a la @new_record_before_save in autosave_association.

Here's the stacktrace against 2-3-stable, but it happens against master and 2-2-stable as well.
