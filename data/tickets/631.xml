  <original-body>This is a patch-in-progress to move the UTC timestamps into migration files, rather than having them as part of the filename.

It was &quot;discussed on the core list&quot;:http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/browse_thread/thread/c431d26d26f0b397

This patch does a couple of things:

 * Changes back to numbering for migration files
 * Adds a timestamp to generated migration files inside the class (self.timestamp = generation_time.to_s
 * Adds the rake:migrations:renumber tasks, which automatically renumbers migrations based on their UTC timestamp

The renumber task is run automatically if the migrate task finds duplicate migrations. 

It's also &quot;svn-aware&quot; for its move command, as svn is the only VCS (in my limited experience) which has problems with files moving.

I know there are no tests; and in fact some fail! I'm working on that, just thought I'd post it so I can get feedback.

Cheers!
