If you say SomeTable.first.moo you will get nil.  SomeTable does not have a column called moo_id.

Shouldn't this at least throw a warning that the column moo_id does not exist?  Maybe even throw some type of exception?

I also see that no sql is actually executed.. Does belongs to have a type of short circuit that first checks the attribute hash and returns nil if the attributes[:fk] returns nil?  If that is the case, should it first check that the key is actually in the attributes hash?</original-body>

      <body>While I can appreciate your comment and agree that overly defensive programming is usually not a good idea and can lead to bloat, I found it strange that I did not get any feedback as to why I was getting nil and no sql was being executed.

I stumbled on this today because a dev was inquring about a relationship on a model we have.  It had a belongs_to :obj relationship but no corresponding col.  After digging, it was left over from some refactoring that was done.  

Wanted to at least capture it here for the Rails devs to decide on its fate.</body>
