  <original-body>At the end of the default Prototype UJS driver, the following event callback is added to re-enable the form's submit button and toggle any data-disable-with values:

&lt;code&gt;
document.on(&quot;ajax:after&quot;, &quot;form&quot;, function(event, element) { ... });
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I believe this callback should be based on the &quot;ajax:complete&quot; event instead though.  Since &quot;ajax:after&quot; is fired immediately after the form submission, and therefore pretty much immediately after &quot;ajax:before&quot;, there is never any time to display the &quot;Saving...&quot; dialogue from the data-disable-with attribute.  Likewise, the submit button is immediately toggled back to an enabled state, potentially allowing unintended multiple submissions.</original-body>

      <body>Sorry. Turns out it was being triggered so fast that it appeared as though it wasn't. So essentially, I'm +1ing the original issue. I've attached the restoration of the submit button to ajax:complete instead of ajax:after, as suggested, and everything functions as expected.</body>

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
