  <original-body>The following route should pick up any route for the application and provide params[:path].

@@@ ruby
My::Application.routes.draw do |map|
  match '*path' =&gt; 'public#go'
end
@@@

With Rails 3 (master), the root path &quot;/&quot; is excluded and doesn't match the route.  Could add an additional root :to =&gt; 'public#go' route, but then it doesn't set params[:path] at all.  Seems like * should indicate everything -- root included.

Just a note, Rails 2.3 catches &quot;/&quot; in the glob and sets params[:path] to an empty string.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
