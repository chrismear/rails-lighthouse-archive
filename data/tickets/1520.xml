  <original-body>The change to line 477 in the compute_public_path method of actionpack/lib/action_view/helpers/asset_tag_helper.rb that happened sometime between Rails 2.0 and Rails 2.1 is incorrectly adding a period to the end of source when ext is nil (as in image_tag) but the source exists as a file.  This makes image_tag work incorrectly on Tomcat, which will not serve up &quot;foo.jpg.&quot;, but will serve up &quot;foo.jpg&quot;.

This is a show stopper critical bug in image_tag when running on Tomcat and trying to upgrade from Rails 2.0.2 to Rails 2.1.2

Currently reads:
              source += &quot;.#{ext}&quot; if ext &amp;&amp; File.extname(source).blank? || File.exist?(File.join(ASSETS_DIR, dir, &quot;#{source}.#{ext}&quot;))

Should read:
              source += &quot;.#{ext}&quot; if ext &amp;&amp; (File.extname(source).blank? || File.exist?(File.join(ASSETS_DIR, dir, &quot;#{source}.#{ext}&quot;)))

Besides creating a patch, it would be helpful to have a workaround before the next Rails 2.1 release</original-body>
