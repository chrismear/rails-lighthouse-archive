  <original-body>If I have a class Project and a subclass SpecialProject, but only map.resources :projects defined in routes, it seems natural that polymorphic_url(@special_projects) would return http://example.com/projects/#{@special_project.id}

Currently, however, it fails looking for the method special_projects_path.

The attached patch (against master) implements a partial solution to this problem. When the named route determined by the normal heuristics is missing, the code walks up the inheritance chain checking if there a suitable route exists. The patch includes thorough test coverage.

Limitations of the patch in it's current state:

1) It handles the inheritance walking for only the last segment of a nested route. Handling more than that opens up more complexity, and while I think it's the right way to go, I thought I would start this conversation modestly.
2) It does not cache the results of the inheritance walking, which could be a opportunity for better performance here.
3) I have not used it in production. It started as a proof of concept and was freshened up in response to some conversation between wycats and brynary.</original-body>

      <body>I like this a lot.

I'd like to see (1) and (2) handled. Caching will make this fast, and therefore viable. Handling only the last segment would probably produce confusion when other parts don't work. I'd also be interested to see if you could make this work against Josh's rack-mount, which will probably form the basis for the Rails 3 router.

I'm attaching this patch to the 2.x milestone since we'll need a different patch against 3.0 once Josh's router is in place.</body>

      <body>So, here's a commit that implements this behavior: https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails/commit/2d298f2a140cdc8388bf09ce517dd73b698c7a4e

Given an array of records it will first build an array of permutations of these record's classes and superclasses (excluding ActiveRecord::Base). Then it will build a named route url generation helper from the first permutation, check if the view responds to it and if so, return the method name. If not, it will try the next permutation and so on.

The first matching permutation will be cached with a cache key that is cheaper to calculate than the whole named route helper method name. I'd expect that this implementation of `build_named_route_call` therefor is also slightly faster than the current one which doesn't use any caching.

Say we have:

@@@
class Site &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end
class Section &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end
class Blog &lt; Section; end
class Content &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end
class Post &lt; Content; end
@@@

Then passing `[site, blog, post]` will try the following permutations:

@@@
site_blog_post_url
site_blog_content_url
site_section_post_url
site_section_content_url
@@@

We're already using something like this, so this code has been extracted from a working code base.

Caching needs to be improved though. Currently we're just populating a mattr_accessor Hash on the NamedRouteCall class. This cache never gets invalidated but probably should be invalidated in development mode. I'm not sure what the best way is to accomplish this. Maybe named route helper methods should be cached on the actual route set which will be thrown away and rebuilt?

Also, the patch above applies to current 3-0-stable. I'm unclear about which branch to base this on.</body>
      <body-html>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, here's a commit that implements this behavior: &lt;a href=
