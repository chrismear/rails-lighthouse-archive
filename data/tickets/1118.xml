  <original-body>Using Rails 2.1.0 I have observed the following unfortunate behaviour.

The problem is observed when creating more than one model using the scaffold method, then destroying one of them later. Example:

ruby script/generate scaffold Book title:string
ruby script/generate scaffold Movie title:string

Now lets say Im editing my Book app, including some edits to the /public/stylesheets/scaffold.css file to make my application look nice.

Lets say now I decide that I dont need the Movie model after all, and delete that by executing:

ruby script/destroy scaffold Movie

Now, in spite of the fact that I still have a model using the .css file, it is deleted by the script. In fact even the entire stylesheets directory is deleted.

I dont think this is a good behaviour of the destroy script.</original-body>
