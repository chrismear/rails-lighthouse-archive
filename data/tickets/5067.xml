  <original-body>Hi,

I was testing feature that I had developed recently and ran into this crash. I'm not able to recover from this crash and am not able to load the local instance even after restarting. The point it crashed was when I tried to edit the  settings of the feature, but my session had expired. When I logged in again, the site starting crashing.

Any ideas on how to recover from this?

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
