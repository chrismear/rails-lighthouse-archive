  <original-body>In January Mighty Boosh submitted a ticket (#3804 at https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3804-inflector-has-wrong-plurals) saying that the inflector pluralized certain words wrong.

Thomas Thornton submitted a patch, and Santiago Pastorino declared it 'wontfix', because there are many irregular inflections, we risk breaking old apps, and it is so easy to add inflections.

I'm submitting a similar ticket because Rails is now moving to 3.x and the risk of that rare octopus table being overwritten is less, and I have a less broad goal.

The inflector will always have errors, but it doesn't seem too hard to keep them out of the test cases.  Attached is a patch that changes octopus to cactus, something that pluralizes to cacti.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
