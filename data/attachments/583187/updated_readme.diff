 == Getting Started
 
 1. At the command prompt, create a new Rails application:
-       <tt>rails myapp</tt> (where <tt>myapp</tt> is the application name)
+       <tt>rails new myapp</tt> (where <tt>myapp</tt> is the application name)
 
 2. Change directory to <tt>myapp</tt> and start the web server:
        <tt>cd myapp; rails server</tt> (run with --help for options)
 
 3. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and you'll see:
-       "Welcome aboard: You're riding the Rails!"
+       "Welcome aboard: You're riding Ruby on Rails!"
 
 4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application. You can find
