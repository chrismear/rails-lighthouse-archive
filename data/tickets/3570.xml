  <original-body>During the course of the development of the depot application, the Product model is updated a number of times, and typically no restart of the server is required.  On occasion, however a change is not picked up.

One common example is the addition of &quot;has_many :orders, :through =&gt; :line_items&quot; done during step 12.1.  Often this works just fine, other times the result is an error such as &quot;undefined method `orders' for #&lt;Product:0xb7073ee4&gt;&quot;.

This does not appear to be a timing problem where multiple edits to the same file occur within the same second; back to back edits in section 6.4 worked just fine, and the edit in section 12.1 was a full 19 seconds after the previous edit to this file.

@@@</body>
      <body-html>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the course of the development of the depot application,
the Product model is updated a number of times, and typically no
restart of the server is required. On occasion, however a change is
not picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common example is the addition of &quot;has_many :orders,
:through =&amp;gt; :line_items&quot; done during step 12.1. Often this works
just fine, other times the result is an error such as &quot;undefined
method &lt;code&gt;orders' for #&amp;lt;Product:0xb7073ee4&amp;gt;&quot;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not appear to be a timing problem where multiple edits
to the same file occur within the same second; back to back edits
in section 6.4 worked just fine, and the edit in section 12.1 was a
full 19 seconds after the previous edit to this file.&lt;/p&gt;
