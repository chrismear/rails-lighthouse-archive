  <original-body>ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper#fields_for now has four params (record, record_object, options, block) in master instead of three (record_or_name_or_array, args, &amp;block) in Rails 3.0.6.

I'm mostly surprised that a public method has changed between releases without deprecation warnings, documentation, etc. It also bugs me that the params are different to ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder#fields_for. The change seems to have been introduced in 58d3b9042302d41f90fc129f12787d83f7bdade9 (&quot;Speed up form_for by specializing extract_options!&quot;) by Yehuda in August (can be found in the diff between v3.0.6 and master).

Ideally this change would be reverted, or perhaps a backwards compatible way to keep the optimisation can be found.</original-body>
