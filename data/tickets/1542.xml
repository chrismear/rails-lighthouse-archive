  <original-body>A cross tabulation compares one variable against the tabulation of another variable. This is often useful when you need to aggregate data in categories.

For example, you may want to find the sum of sales for each department in a supermarket. Given the schema:

 Departments: id, name
 Sales: id, department_id, amount

and the example data:

Departments:
 +------------------+
 | id |    name     |
 |----+-------------+
 | 1  | Vegetables  |
 | 2  | Deli        |
 | 3  | Frozen      |
 +------------------+

Sales:
 +-----------------------------+
 | id | department_id | amount |
 |----+---------------+--------+
 | 1  |       1       | 11     |
 | 1  |       1       | 111    |
 | 2  |       2       | 22     |
 | 2  |       2       | 222    |
 | 3  |       3       | 3      |
 +-----------------------------+

You would want the output:
 +----------------------------+
 | Vegetables | Deli | Frozen |
 |------------+------+--------+
 |    122     |  244 |   3    |
 +----------------------------+

Which could be achieved using the method call:
 Department.cross('name', :aggregator =&gt; 'sum', aggregator_column =&gt; 'amount', :joins =&gt; 'INNER JOIN sales ON sales.department_id = departments.id')</original-body>

comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&quot;&gt;ugg classic crochet is
well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new
decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic
Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to
personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the

not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are
worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about
yourself. Today&amp;#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They
are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has
become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most
important factors that will decide success in various areas of
life. It can boost up your confidence level.&lt;br&gt;

them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</body-html>
