  <original-body>On Rails::Initializer, configuration.load_once_paths is frozen but config.load_paths is not.

We need to freeze them so future modifications will fail rather than do nothing mysteriously. For example, I was changing the variable on my environment/development.rb and the path I was setting was never loaded.

To fix, just add the line:

  configuration.load_paths.freeze

To railties/lib/initializer.rb, method set_autoload_paths, around line 214.

So we will have:

  def set_autoload_paths
    Dependencies.load_paths = configuration.load_paths.uniq
    Dependencies.load_once_paths = configuration.load_once_paths.uniq

    extra = Dependencies.load_once_paths - Dependencies.load_paths
    unless extra.empty?
      abort &lt;&lt;-end_error
        load_once_paths must be a subset of the load_paths.
        Extra items in load_once_paths: #{extra * ','}
      end_error
    end

    configuration.load_once_paths.freeze

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool.
