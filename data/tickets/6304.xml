  <original-body>The find method can be made just a little bit faster. Nothing to be perceived on a single run, but to be noticed after some running up requests.
Basically, we can replace the case/when statement with a if/include, gaining 10% speed on that.
See more details and a demonstration of the improvement in [my post on this issue](http://www.miguelsanmiguel.com/2011/01/17/the-case-of-case-when-vs-if-include &quot;The case of 'case/when' vs 'if/include'&quot;) (sorry for self citing).
I attach a diff with the suggested code. I tested it against the provided suite and it passed.
It just needs to be reviewed and applied.</original-body>

      <body>Sorry, [I forgot to check exhaustively] (http://raflabs.com/blogs/silence-is-foo/2010/08/07/ruby-idioms-what-is-the-splatunary-operator-useful-for/comment-page-1/#comment-7062). It [looks like] (https://gist.github.com/783662) it is very dependent of the usage. If your application has many *find_by_ids* (which I do not think is the normal case), then my patch works 40% faster. If not, 25-30% slower.

I vote for forgetting about it...</body>

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
