  <original-body>I am trying to use a different layout than the default application.html.haml in my Rails 3.0 app. as shown below:

@@@ ruby
class AdminController &lt; ApplicationController
  layout &quot;admin&quot;
  def instruct
  end
  ...
end
@@@

This is my layouts/admin.html.haml file:

@@@ ruby
 - content_for :secondary_nav do
  = navigation :second_level_admin
= render :file =&gt; &quot;layouts/application&quot;
@@@

Then I yield to :secondary_nav in my application.html.haml as shown below:

@@@ ruby
.....
= yield :secondary_nav
@@@

My app/views/admin/instruct.html.haml is rendered with no layout!

The same code works fine in Rails 2.3.8

Layouts for file_manager238 are elegant.  They are ugly for file_manager3.  Quite possibly this is a function of my ignorance about Rails 3.0.

Please take a look and let me know if this is my problem of Rails 3.0 problem.

In short I am suggesting you to try to not to refer to application.html.erb from admin layout.</body>

the reason I call application.html.haml is because it creates a nested menu effect.  Two layer menu or sub-menu if you will.  I have examples running on heroku at URL:

http://empty-fog-47.heroku.com/

just login as as admin with userid/password as(system/important) and click on the admin tab.  You will see why am I calling application.html.haml

      <body>@Bharart I am sure whatever is the code inside application.html.haml you can extract it out and call it something like _foo.html.haml . And then try using _foo partial from admin layout.

Since application.html.haml has special meaning this might solve your problem.</body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
