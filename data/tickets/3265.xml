  <original-body>These are the scripts I use to set up the official rails CI servers.  They are still evolving, and I want to rewrite them all to use Chef, but I'd like to get them committed from my branch so I don't have to keep merging.  Some of them are useful for setting up the build environment too, such as setup_rails_dependencies.rb.</original-body>
