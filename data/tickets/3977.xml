  <original-body>I just went on to install latest Rails from git, and to my big surprise, it was great PITA. After cloning the repo, I went on to run the test suite, and I was greeted by loads of missing dependencies, and no way to install them all by single command, which reminds me of... ice age?

So after installing everything by hand, really nice thing to do, I finally was able to run test suite. Hooray! It worked! So, let's install that beast - rake -T, hmm, no install task? Weird, okay, let's make some gems - rake gem. Cool I have my gems, oops. Where are they? Ah, each one in separate folder, so no single command like gem install -l pkg/*.gem

I hope you improve on this guys because if you are already at 3.ob , one would guess that such a basic issues should be resolved.

PS: gem install rails --prerelease, is installing 1.x gems</original-body>

 * gem install bundler
 * bundle install
 * rake test
 * rake install

The rake install task exists even though it doesn't appear in a rake -T</body>
