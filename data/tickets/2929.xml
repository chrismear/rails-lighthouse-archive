  <original-body>Hi, can you reopen ticket the following ticket please https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/2905-named-routes-do-not-handle-parameters-with-a-in-the-values. I can't see how to reopen it or how to contact the dev's that commented on the ticket. Apologies if this isn't the most efficient way of doing this.

I have tested it from another machine and the problem I outlined in my final comment should act as a suitable test case. Either it's a stupid user error on my part, a real bug or something really weird is going on :)

Again, it's Rails 2.3.2 I'm using</original-body>
