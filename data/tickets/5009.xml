  <original-body>I've been working with Rails 3 beta 4 for a while on the Mac, then I switched to my PC laptop to test the site out.  In IE (6,7, and 8), all the Ajax forms stopped working (it got me freak out a bit).  After debugging the code for a while, it turned out that the even with the :remote =&gt; true option, IE just does not support event bubbling for the submit event.  The comment in rails.js (around line 93) is 

    // TODO: I don't think submit bubbles in IE
    $(document.body).observe(&quot;submit&quot;, function(event) {...

With :remote =&gt; true doesn't work in IE, this is a huge issue and I don't think Rails can be shipped without this feature fully working. 

My thinking is that specifically for the &quot;forms_for :remote =&gt; true&quot;, the onSubmit event of the form need to explicitly call the handleRemote() method in the rails.js file so that the event can be captured, processed, and stopped appropriately.  It's not a very &quot;unobtrusive&quot; solution, but I don't see away to work around this issue.  My knowledge of Rails internal stuff is not that great yet, but I will take a look into the actionpack code to see if I can find a work around.

Is there anyone who's also looking into this issue?</original-body>
