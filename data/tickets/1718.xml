  <original-body>I am having problems with expiring action caches in Rails 2.2. I have a configured the route for a controller named Pages to appear as &quot;pagine&quot; using the :as option. I am using the file based cache and the caching works and the created files match the route (e.g. /pagine/1). However when I try and expire the action it looks for a file that matches the controller name rather than the name I gave.

So rather than trying to delete /pagine/1 it tries to delete /pages/1 and so the action is never expired.</original-body>
