  <original-body>Currently TemplateRunner only sets an instance variable for @root, giving the path to the rails app being created. It would be nice if the template variable was also exposed as an instance variable. This way in the event that you have some static resources that you want to put into your new app, they're easy to get to. 

Right now the only way to get to that information is through $*, and best guess that you have the right index.</original-body>

      <body>You can just refer to the template within your template as template (wow, clear as mud)...here's a bit of code where I grab a config file that's sitting in the same folder as the template:

@@@
template_path = File.expand_path(File.dirname(template), File.join(root,'..'))
config_file = File.join(template_path, &quot;config.yml&quot;)
@@@

Somewhat convoluted to ensure it works whether the templaet is specified by relative or absolute path when it's invoked.

If this isn't what you're after, feel free to reopen with more information.</body>
