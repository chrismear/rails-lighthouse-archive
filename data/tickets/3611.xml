  <original-body>I had some problems loading an activerecord connection adapter. AR constantly raised an error telling me to install the gem in question. It feels like 2357 times I checked it and the load paths and anything. Until I found that the load error was not raised by the require statement that loaded the adapter but inside one of the loaded library which was missing something.

This code should check what could not be loaded.

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
