  <original-body>In Rails 2.3.8 I discovered that `accepts_nested_attributes_for` may skip updating existing records under certain circumstances. I pulled my hair out yesterday because of this: In the application it didn't update my nested objects, reproducing this on the console updated the objects. It took me some hours to discover the difference (after finding many reports for similar bugs and workaround/solutions which didn't work for me):

In the application I did

@@@ ruby
class TestController &lt; ApplicationController
  # class Container belongs_to :location; end
  # class Location has_many :containers; accepts_nested_attributes_for :containers, :allow_destroy =&gt; true; end

  def update
    @location = Location.find(params[:id])
    if @location.update_attributes params[:location]
      #...
    end
  end
end
@@@

This never worked, although the `:containers_attributes` hash was correctly passed in by the params hash. Only new records were added to the association. Existing records couldn't be updated or destroyed.

To investigate I copy/pasted the hash from the log to the console doing the following way:

@@@
$ script/console
&gt; l = Location.find(123)
&gt; l.containers.inspect   #&lt;-- to see if the prerequisites for the following hash are met
&gt; l.update_attributes(:containers_attributes =&gt; { ... })  #&lt;-- copied from the development.log
&gt; l.reload.containers.inspect   #&lt;-- compare: it worked!
@@@

Now what was the difference? After a few hours of google'ing around it not easy to still have a view for that, but finally I discovered the small difference:

In my controller I didn't load the containers association prior to updating it while on the console I did. Adding `:include =&gt; :containers` to the Location finder fixed all my problems.

I think it is a bug in Rails that it does not implicitly do that if the association has not been loaded upon mass assignment to `Location#containers_attributes=`. It should be fixed.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
