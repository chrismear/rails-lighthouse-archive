  <original-body>Hello,

Other than I can't open links in any of my emails; I am now finding that ALL of my emails are downloading looking like they were done in MS PUBLISHER form, i.e., they have cells, etc.


I cannot find a solution to this problem on any of the forums that I have asked this question on and I have posted this question on many sites/forums.

Pleas, oh please, can you find a solution or find a site where others are having the same problem? And have fixed or addressed this problem?

Thank you.

Blessings.
