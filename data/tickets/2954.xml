  <original-body>Hi.

I've just cloned Edge Rails from github. Once mocha gem installed, rake seems to run smoothly but with postgresql. While in the activerecord folder, I ran rake postgresql:build_databases and even had GRANT ALL on the activerecord_unittest* databases for both myself and rails user. I attach a log from the command &quot;rake test_postgresql &gt; output.log&quot; (featuring some French error sentences inside, sorry).

I hope I did not forget something meant to be obvious (say, a gem dependency?) :)
Thank you.</original-body>

      <body>I found a workaround for this issue. A [Foxy Fixtures patch issued on 2007](http://209.85.129.132/search?q=cache:Y5-PNnmPPiQJ:dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/9981+http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/9981&amp;cd=1&amp;ct=clnk &quot;2007 bug issue&quot;) tackles the problem. I did a research in Lighthouse but it seems everybody is running pg fine with superuser privileges since there is no occurrence for this error :)

http://kopongo.com/2008/7/25/postgres-ri_constrainttrigger-error#comment-form is also a valuable resource, and http://schuerig.de/michael/blog/index.php/2007/11/08/testing-with-foreign-key-constraints/ may be useful as well.

So basically, if the pg user used to run the tests on activerecord_unittest* databases does not have superuser privileges, the current implementation of Active Record PG adaptater will fail with a PGError related to disabling/enabling triggers. There seems to be two solutions:
- run rake test_postgresql with a pg superuser-granted account;
- in activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adaptaters/postgresql_adaptater.rb, alter 451-460 to:
@@@ ruby
def disable_referential_integrity(&amp;block)
  transaction {
    begin
      execute &quot;SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED&quot;
      yield
    ensure
      execute &quot;SET CONSTRAINTS ALL IMMEDIATE&quot;
    end
  }
end
@@@
This however makes supports_disable_referential_integrity() useless, so I guess refactoring would be preferable if a patch is needed. For the moment, it suits my needs (that is passing the tests) and I don't know if a patch is actually needed: is it a bug or a feature?

I then wonder: *must* I make my pg user a superuser if I am to contribute to Edge Rails? This seems strange to me as it's a bold requirement, but maybe that's the standard way to go (not really obvious reading the documentation though).

Also, I'd like to know if there is a privileged place to set a require 'my_workaround_for_postgresql_triggers' so rake test_postgresql runs. For the moment, I just edited my clone lib file, but that's lame :) Maybe I'll go for a pg superuser in the end&#8230;</body>

      <body>Hi,

A while ago I used to use the deferred constraints approach too but obviously we can't rely on it because it only works if the constraints are actually set up to be deferrable and that is something we can't require nor detect at this point.

Also, this is actually less relevant to contributing to edge rails (as AR test data does not contain FK constraints) and more relevant to developing rails apps that use FK constraints. For developing rails it seems reasonable for me to require super user privileges, for developing rails apps I do remember some people who had to use a database outside their control (and thus no superuser privileges) and for them this obviously is a problem, but I'm really not sure how to solve this.

One thing that should make things better for people who don't use FK constraints would be to not disable triggers if the database does not have FK constraints, but before we can do that we need support for introspecting those constraints.

As for you, I'd suggest going the superuser route for now, unless you have complex privilege rules which your rails apps must be able to work with or are running this on a production database it should be fine.</body>

      <body>This has been an issue for many years.  I wish it would get fixed.  No, it is not reasonable to require super user privileges just to develop rails.  I understand that most Rails users do not understand constraints but the belief that Rails can protect the database from corruption has never been true and never will be true.  Indeed there are comments in the Rails code to this effect.

I put this (along with a few other snippets) into config/initializers/patches.rb

Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to
personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the
Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed
down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does
not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are
worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about
yourself. Today&amp;#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They
are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has
become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most
important factors that will decide success in various areas of
life. It can boost up your confidence level.&lt;br&gt;
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&quot;&gt;uggs for cheapCrochet Tall
boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because
Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only
does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum
raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because
she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears
them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</body-html>
