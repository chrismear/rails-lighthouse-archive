  <original-body>I have created a few plugins, and I can run 'rake test' from inside their dirs just fine. But once I am using them in a Rails project, and try 'rake test:plugins', I was getting this weird message from rake, saying that my test_* functions were already defined.
After messing around a bit, I noticed that, when test:plugins is run, Rails will execute the code in config/boot twice.
Here is a simple example:

$ rails temp
$ cd temp
$ ./script/generate plugin foobar
edit config/boot.rb:
     def boot!
      unless booted?
        puts &quot;TEST_STRING!!!&quot;
        preinitialize
        pick_boot.run
      end

nicolae:temp zeh$ rake test:plugins
(in /Users/zeh/temp)
TEST_STRING!!!
/opt/local/bin/ruby -I&quot;lib:test&quot; &quot;/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rake-0.8.7/lib/rake/rake_test_loader.rb&quot; &quot;vendor/plugins/foobar/test/foobar_test.rb&quot;

Started
.
Finished in 0.03464 seconds.

1 tests, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors

that string will show up twice. the same doesn't happen with other rake tasks, like db:migrate, db:drop:all, test, gem -- nor while running console or server (only once).

I might be mistaken, but I don't think that's the desired behavior.</original-body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
