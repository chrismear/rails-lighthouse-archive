  <original-body>actionpack/RUNNING_UNIT_TESTS explains how to run a single test suite by executing something like:

  ruby dispatch/running_test.rb

which at first glance seemed like a typo to me and I ended executing:

  ruby test/dispatch/routing_test.rb

which thrown an error because abstract_unit couldn't be loaded. After looking for the cause of the error I conclude the instructed command was ok, it just was that I have to execute it from the test directory or execute something like:

  ruby -Itest test/dispatch/routing_tests.rb
  ruby -Ctest dispatch/routing_tests.rb

I improved a little bit the documentation so other developers don't make the same error as me and they could contribute faster with Rails :)</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
