  <original-body>Currently the reload ActiveResource method calls find and then calls load. This leads to the load method being called twice; once in the initialize method that the call to find leads to and then again in the reload method itself. This becomes a problem in the event the object being reloaded includes an array of objects. In this scenario the first call to load creates and hydrates the object as well as all the sub objects. When load is called the second time the attributes from the just loaded object are sent as a param. This is a problem because the attributes method isn't deep, so a hash is sent that includes arrays of hydrated objects. In the load method this eventually leads to line 1036 which attempts to initialize an object by passing an object as an argument rather than a hash.

I think this issue would also occur with any nested object, but I haven't tested all cases.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
