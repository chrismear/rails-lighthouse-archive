  <original-body>I have a case where I have a hash object as a property of a alternative-ORM model, which I want to make form fields for. Using the fields_for helper almost works, except in one case, where it attempts to call #new_record? on the hash. Attached is a patch to check for the method first, and it works great.

As an example, the model I'm trying to construct fields for is generated like this:

    def build_metric_filter
      @metric_filter = MetricFilter.new
      @metric_filter.criteria = [{:target =&gt; &quot;Hostname&quot;, :comparison =&gt; &quot;is&quot;, :pattern =&gt; &quot;&quot;}]
      @metric_filter
    end</original-body>
