Are you complaining that the auto generated scaffold tests are not taking account of the nested route? If so I think that's asking a bit much of something that's meant just to get you started on writing your tests. What about where a controller is used both in a nested and non-nested scope, e.g:

@@@ ruby
resources :manufacturers, :only =&gt; :show do
  resources :products, :only =&gt; :index
end

resources :products, :only =&gt; [:index, :show]
@@@

In this case you need two tests. As I said scaffold is just a guide to get you started - it's not there to build your application for you.</body>
