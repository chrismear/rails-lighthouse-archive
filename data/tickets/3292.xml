  <original-body>There are two tests that are currently failing in both master and 2-3-stable if Feb 21st 2039 is considered DST on your local time zone. 

The problem is that DateTime.local_offset is used to calculate one of the local times, and Time.local is used to create the other. As DateTimes are not aware of any DST rules, the resulting times have a difference of one hour and therefore the tests fail.

I've attached a patch that fixes the broken tests by forcing the time zone to US/Eastern for these tests. The patch applies cleanly to both master and 2-3-stable.

As we're not specifically testing DST calculation in any of these tests, I think there's no need to duplicate the tests using the NZ (or any other) time zone. If you think this is needed I will adjust the patch accordingly.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
