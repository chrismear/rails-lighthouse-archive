  <original-body>A long while back, Rails added the ability for plugin authors to include Rake tasks in their plugins by including a `tasks` directory.  Any `*.rake` files included in that directory would be automatically loaded by Rails via `tasks/rails` in `Rakefile`.

Frozen gems should be able to take advantage of the same feature.  It is a trivial update to the core (+1 LOC), slightly broadening a feature that already exists.  This &quot;problem&quot; was mentioned 3 years ago in [this ticket](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/6410), but at the time was marked as a duplicate against a ticket which didn't address the issue.

Currently - since this is not included in Rails by default - it appears to &quot;break&quot; several popular plugin/gems, specifically Tobi's Delayed Job and Thoughtbot's Paperclip, by not having the pre-bundled tasks readily available once frozen.

Attached is the +1 LOC patch to enable frozen gem tasks.</original-body>

      <body>Tests were added at the request of Manfred Stienstra (manfred-s) in #rails-contrib.

A custom `task_test.rb` file was added since the tests require loading `rake` and friends.  I didn't want to dirty any of the existing non-rake-specific test files in railties.

At some point, the `task_test.rb` should probably be extended to ensure that both `vendor/plugins/**/tasks/**/*.rake` and `lib/tasks/*.rake` are being properly loaded.  But that didn't seem appropriate for this specific patch.</body>

      <body>Hey Matt.  You are correct, [Tyler Hunt](http://tylerhunt.com/) and I were talking about that a few days ago when I had him read through it.

I actually created something that _could_ work for installed - but not frozen - gems.  However, it required loading the Rails environment for every Rake task, which certainly isn't a good thing to do (it uses `Rails.configuration` to pull the dependent gems and then reading the gem specs for the locally-installed directory and scanning for a tasks subdirectory).

Honestly, I don't see it as a down side to only support frozen gems.  Doing so does not take away current functionality, but rather enhances it.  Certainly it's not a 100% solution, but on a effort-to-reward ratio, I think it significantly outweighs any solutions I could come up with for supporting it all.</body>
