  <original-body>I'd like to be able to specify additional paths for migrations to be located in.  This patch adds that feature.  The primary use case I'm thinking for this is to be able to have something like rails/migrations inside of gems, but I suppose there could be other situations where this could be useful.</original-body>

      <body>I'm really against scattared migrations. I think we should just make it easy to copy migrations from engines/plugins/gems to app's db/migrate directory.

Now that engines are in the core, they'll need a similar functionality. So please do bring this up in IRC/mailing list if it hasn't been resolved in time of 2.3.

Thanks!</body>

      <body>Yeah, I'm fine with not adding this.  I ended up writing a generator to copy the migrations from my gem to the app.  Since they are timestamped, there's no problem.  If it were up to me, I'd let people do what they want with the framework and store migrations in multiple places if that's what makes sense for the app, but having the generator copy them into the app is good enough work around.</body>
