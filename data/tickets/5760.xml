  <original-body>action_controller/url_rewriter depends upon the URI library from Ruby's standard library, but it doesn't require it. This patch simply adds the missing require 'uri'.

Ran into this issue when I upgraded some dependencies and redeployed -- Rails couldn't boot because I was configuring ActionMailer settings in config/environments/production.rb, which loads ActionMailer::Base, which includes ActionController::UrlWriter, which is missing the require 'uri', resulting in a missing constant error for ActionController::UrlWriter::URI.

Didn't get this error in development or test because I wasn't configuring ActionMailer in those environments. Nasty bug with an easy fix.</original-body>
