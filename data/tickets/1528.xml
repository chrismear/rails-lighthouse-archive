  <original-body>When issuing ActiveRecord.count queries, include options are now turned into joins indiscriminately. This patch copies the strategy from associations.rb construct_finder_sql_for_association_limiting by only adding include joins to the query if they are referenced by the condition string.

Some may say, well just don't put the includes in the options but that's a lot of things to think about. 

This saves me from my stupidity since I  use a hack of the &quot;paginating_find&quot; plugin, which does a count of a limited query before firing the actual query. 

No new tests included in the patch. All the (previously passing) tests still pass.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
