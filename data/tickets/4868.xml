  <original-body>I think this behavior most likely predates Rails 3, but I'm just starting to zero in on it now.

I've noticed that the url_helpers are available in my sweepers (ActionController::Caching::Sweeper subclasses) in my development and production environments, but not in my test environment.

For example, in the production/development environments this kind of sweeper works:

    class ProductSweeper &lt; ActionController::Caching::Sweeper
      observe Product
    
      def after_save product
        expire_page(product_path(product) + '.html')
      end
    end

The same call fails in the test environment because product_path() always returns nil.

It would appear that the cause is that the url_helpers haven't been included in the sweeper in that environment, and so the &quot;method_missing&quot; handling in actionpack/lib/action_controller/caching/sweeping.rb kicks in and returns nil. (And obviously, expire_page(nil + '.html') doesn't do anything helpful.)

If I explicitly include the helpers by adding this to the sweeper:

    include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers

Then the sweeper works in the test environment.

I'm currently trying to identify why it is that the helpers are included in all environments except the test environment. If anybody knows why, please comment. Seems like a bug because it's surprising at best, and inconsistent at worst.</original-body>

      <body>Well, I don't actually know the solution, I only know a workaround: ie. explicitly including the url helpers in each sweeper (this effectively means that in the development and production environments they get included twice, but it seems harmless).

I've tried to trace through the code paths in the different environments to work out _why_ the helpers are included in one two environments and not the others, but I haven't yet been able to figure it out. I haven't given up trying though, just haven't had time to get to the bottom of it yet.

As for the test, yes, I can probably get that done even if I can't figure out the real cause.</body>

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.
