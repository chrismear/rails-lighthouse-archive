  <original-body>I'm sure this is a common error but I'm new to Rails and can't figure out how to fix it. Basically I'm going through a tutorials and executed the following command:


***-iMac:~ ***$ script/rails generate controller Explore database=mysql

Then I remembered that the command for database might be wrong so I executed this:

***-iMac:~ ***$ script/rails generate controller Explore --database=mysql

Now there is a problem with the generate command. Here is my routes.rb file. (I'm not familiar with formatting on this site so you'll have to excuse me)
