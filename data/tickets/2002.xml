  <original-body>ActiveResource::HttpMock will raise InvalidRequestError when the incoming request does not exactly match the stubbed requests' path, method, and request headers.  

Many times in testing however, the test is not concerned with the actual query-string portion of the path, or the specific request headers sent, but is more interested in stubbing a particular response or status for any request that is similar in nature.   This often occurs with custom request methods such as:

/people/custom_method.xml?query_param_array%5Bname%5D=val

The url-encoding and query-string need to match exactly in the declaration of the HttpMock respond_to block, or the request path will not match.

I've attached a patch for HttpMock, and associated unit tests, that allows for specification of match_options :lax_path and :ignore_headers to reduce the burden on the test author in cases like this.</original-body>

      <body>+1 on this idea. I've run into many headaches trying to mock index calls with different behaviors based on parameters I'm passing.

I'm not sure of the option lax_path, as legacy tests will probably want the default behavior to remain unsensitive to parameters. Maybe something like :strict_uri, or :exact_uri

Great idea.</body>

      <body>@Dan P.  Thanks for the comment.  I too would prefer the default behavior for path matching to not be concerned with parameters, but was hesitant to change the behavior in case legacy tests actually depend on a strict match.</body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
