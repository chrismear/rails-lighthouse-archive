  <original-body>Doing any command in 2.2 in development mode (eg script/generate) seems to take WAY to long, on the order of 5-10 seconds. I'm wondering if this is because of all of the load time caching that rails is now doing with loadpaths/etc.

Is anyone else having this issue?

I'm running on cygwin mainly but I'm also seeing this on Fedora Core 8.

On ruby 1.8.6 with a few gems and plugins in a basic app (2 controllers).</original-body>
