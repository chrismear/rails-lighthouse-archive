  <original-body>This evening I was tripped up by the way :offset works in ActiveRecord::Base#find.  I was under the impression that you could just specify an offset and get all other records.  The documentation states: &quot;:offset - An integer determining the offset from where the rows should be fetched. So at 5, it would skip rows 0 through 4.&quot;.

In reality, you're required to specify a :limit as well.  The way I got around this was by setting the limit to 'current_user.mymodels.count'.

I just wanted to point out that it's not documented that :limit is required for :offset to work.  I actually had to go into the active record code to see why it wasn't working.</original-body>
