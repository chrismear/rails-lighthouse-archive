  <original-body>Background:

When running e.g. tests that take a few minutes, most users (or is it only me?) use rake db:migrate and then do something else. In a bigger project it is quite common that fetching the latest changes from git added a new migration file.

Because the console is in the background often times the user doesn't know that the migrations haven't been applied yet and time is wasted. A default error/warn sound could help notify the user that there's a problem.

The attached patch is tiny and basically just adds the beep character to the error message.</original-body>

      <body>Something clever about rake is that when you do something that in any other rails item (say a method) would be redefining it, instead rake appends this action onto the rake task. this is how you could accomplish this. 

Here shows what i mean by what i said in that first sentence:

@@@ ruby
task :foo do
  puts &quot;bar&quot;
end

task :foo do
  puts &quot;baz&quot;
end
@@@

when you run it, this happens:
@@@
&#9889; rake foo
(in ~/Git/rails-three/tester)
bar
baz
@@@

I think that this is probably bloat for core rails, but i have done a little hacking and here's a snippet for your Rakefile (didn't work in a lib/tasks/*.rake file during my testing sadly)

@@@ ruby
task :plink_on_abort do
  def abort(string=nil)
    $stderr.print &quot;\a&quot;
    super
  end
end
if Rake::Task.task_defined?(&quot;db:abort_if_pending_migrations&quot;)
  Rake::Task[&quot;db:abort_if_pending_migrations&quot;].prerequisites &lt;&lt; &quot;plink_on_abort&quot; 
end
@@@

      <body>My last comment was a little unclear. Usually the first method works, but not in this case when your addition is in the middle of lots of logic. Hence Why i showed you that snippet. If you wanted to have an even more simple solution, for it to plink on *every* abort, just redefine abort as i have, but at the top level in the Rakefile.</body>

      <body>Thanks for your help!
I realized it's really not a good idea to patch something like this into rails core. You can mark this ticket as invalid.

I actually found a neat way of solving this problem (getting notified when rake tasks are finished) with the rakegrowl gem:

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as their   handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that don't have   this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to style and   pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold loafers to slingbacks   with open toes. You may be able to find Coach shoes at discount prices online,   but be sure that you are buying genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous, Coach   shoes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chanelpursesbags.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chanel purses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can do that well. Coach sneakers and heels will make you   feel sporty, too. When selecting pumps or sandals to wear, you'll be happy to   count on the long-standing quality and service of the Coach company. They have   many styles to choose from, including chic and glamorous Coach boots and Coach   heels. Whether you are looking for sports shoes like Coach sneakers or sexy   shoes like Coach boots, the Coach name will never let you down.&lt;/p&gt;</body>
