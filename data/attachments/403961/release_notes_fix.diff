@@ -39,8 +39,8 @@ h4. script/* replaced by script/rails
 The new <tt>script/rails</tt> replaces all the scripts that used to be in the <tt>script</tt> directory. You do not run <tt>script/rails</tt> directly though, the +rails+ command detects it is being invoked in the root of a Rails application and runs the script for you. Intended usage is:
 
 <shell>
-rails console                      # => ./script/rails console
-rails g scaffold post title:string # => ./script/rails generate scaffold post title:string
+rails console                      # instead of ./script/console
+rails g scaffold post title:string # instead of ./script/generate scaffold post title:string
 </shell>
 
 Run rails --help for a list of all the options.
