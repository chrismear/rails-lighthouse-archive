  <original-body>This discussion started on #5348 but that ticket has diverged into a separate issue.

The issue here is that `helper :all` doesn't respect the current controller/view. So calling helpers can yield unexpected results.

This gist shows how to reproduce the issue in both 2.3.8 and 3.0.0.rc2 http://gist.github.com/517669. This may be a wont-fix since it seems this has been the behaviour for several releases now. 

IMO this behaviour seems to go against the use case for helpers, yet it's the default in Rails 2.3.8 and its a non-optional part of the framework in 3.0.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
