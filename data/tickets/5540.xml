  <original-body>Unlike other gems in the rails distribution (actionmailer, actionpack and activemodel'), the gems for rails, activerecord, activeresoure, active support and railties gems do not include the MIT-LICENSE under which the software is distributed.  This is because the file is not named in the .gemspec file for those gems only.

The attached patch modifies those .gemspecs to conform to the other gems, including the MIT-LICENSE file.  Additionally, it adds the MIT-LICENSE file to the root of the repository, and modifies rails.gemspec to include those files with the binary distribution.

While not addressed in this patch, I note that arel likewise does not distribute the MIT-LICENSE.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
