    %h2 Introduction
    %p
      Digital voice systems for two-way radio, including the well-known
      %b D*STAR
      system used by Radio Amateurs and the
      %b APCO 25
      system used by public service agencies are based on proprietary voice
      codecs. These systems are trade-secret, patented, and are copyrighted
      with all rights reserved. Neither the operators of the systems or their
      manufacturers can tell you all details of how their voice encoding
      works. That information is known only to one company, which sells
      preprogrammed ICs containing the
      %br AMBE
      codec. AMBE is also used in the
      %b AOR 9000
      digital SSB system, and the
      %b DV Dongle.
      A
      %i pirated
      version of AMBE is used by many
      %b Digital Radio Mondial (DRM)
      operators.
    %p
      While commercial and public-service radio systems could get along with
      a proprietary codec,
      %i it's a dead-end for Amateur radio. It's time to do something
      about it.
    %p
      Obviously, much of the new development and experimentation in Amateur
      Radio is done in software. Many of us use sound-cards and software
      modulation systems on the air. The leading-edge uses more sophisticated
      systems like the
      %b SDR-1000
      and
      %b SDR-5000
      from
      %i FlexRadio Systems
      and the
      %b USRP
      board from
      %i Matt Ettus.
      But how do these systems interoperate with
      %b D*STAR
      voice, and other modes using the AMBE codec?
      To do so legally, they must use the
      %b DV Dongle,
      a $200 device incorporating an AMBE chip that plugs into a computer
      via USB. This device does not provide any performance accelleration,
      it's only purpose is to provide access to a trade-secret algorithm
      that isn't available to Radio Amateurs in any other legitimate form.
    %h2 The Solution
    %p
      Obviously,
      %b AMBE
      could be replaced by Open Source software, eliminating an unnecessary
      high cost,
      opening the door for experimentation in voice coding algorithms,
      and providing an path for the incorporation of digital voice into AMSAT
      satellites. But the existing Open Source codecs, like
      %i Speex,
      aren't quite good enough.
    %h2 AMSAT
    %p
      The problem of proprietary codecs is particularly severe for AMSAT,
      because in general it's impractical to fly firmware on an AMSAT
      satellite.
      Radiation, temperature, and vaccumm are a killing environment for
      any kind of computer memory, and
      of course there's no servicing the satellite, so reliability must be
      tremendous.
      Indeed, AMSAT satellites don't even have a boot ROM! They
      use a 100% hardware circuit to load their computer RAM from a
      ground data stream.
      Satellite computers implement full CRC (a system for correcting
      multiple-bit errors) on their RAM, and they continuously
      &quot;wash&quot; the RAM by checking the CRC and correcting
      radiation-induced errors.
    %p
      Thus, having a software CODEC is essential if AMSAT satellites are
      to interact with the voice stream rather than simply repeat the data
      packets. Future AMSAT designs, to facilitate nationwide safety
      communications during natural disasters, will need an advanced digital
      voice capability.
    %p
      Obviously the AMBE manufacturer doesn't want AMSAT broadcasting their
      algorithm when they program a satellite. They don't generally give
      anyone, even manufacturers like ICOM, their software. They just sell
      chips with the software pre-installed on them in an unreadable form.
    %p
      Thus, this is a significant problem for AMSAT. Ric Hambly, AMSAT's
      president, heard me give a keynote speech including this topic at the
      %i TAPR/ARRL Digital Communications Conference, 
      and asked me to continue to work on the problem.
