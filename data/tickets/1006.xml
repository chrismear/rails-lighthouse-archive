  <original-body>This is really a suggestion, maybe I can plant a seed and it will grow into something. I'm sure I'm not the first person to mention this either.

With jQuery in the picture it doesn't make sense to tie rails down to prototype. All of the javascript helpers are prototype specific, etc. Also, with jQuery, javascript helpers in general are not needed because its so easy to write unobtrusive javascript. Wouldn't it be smarter to extract all of this prototype specific code out into a plugin?

Every time I update rails I have to go in and delete the javascript files that I don't want, etc. Just seems very &quot;unrails&quot; like.

At the time rails was created prototype was probably the best choice, but I'm not sure that's true anymore. Maybe it's time to rethink this?

Just something I was thinking about. Thanks for listening.</original-body>
