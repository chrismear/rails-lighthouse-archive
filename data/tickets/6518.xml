  <original-body>I'm not sure what the hell went wrong but I used rvm to test my app under ruby 1.9.2 because it was taking forever to respond to http requests under Rails 3 in development under 1.8.7. I discovered that there was a pre version of mongrel (1.2.0.pre2), updated that, and it fixed the issue.

I changed rvm back to default (1.8.7) and installed the latest mongrel pre version. I updated my Gemfile and ran &quot;bundle install&quot; and after that things started breaking. Bundler wanted to install all the gems into a gem directory called calendar_date_select (which was one of my gems in the Gemfile). After I found the .bundler/config file which had a setting for the bundle directory  pointing to calendar_date_select (what? how'd that happen?) and deleted it and was able to update the gem bundle and start the server under the new mongrel.

As soon as I hit the app with the web browser I got the error. Ok, so maybe this mongrel version isn't compatible so I reverted back to 1.1.5 and the problem still persists. Aside from the original issue it was all working before using rvm so I figure there must be something I've done wrong and there may be a bug as well. I'm stumped!

The entire exception is below. 

Thanks,

Chris

      <body>I'm not sure what the hell went wrong but I used rvm to test my app under ruby 1.9.2 because it was taking forever to respond to http requests under Rails 3 in development under 1.8.7. I discovered that there was a pre version of mongrel (1.2.0.pre2), updated that, and it fixed the issue.

I changed rvm back to default (1.8.7) and installed the latest mongrel pre version. I updated my Gemfile and ran &quot;bundle install&quot; and after that things started breaking. Bundler wanted to install all the gems into a gem directory called calendar_date_select (which was one of my gems in the Gemfile). After I found the .bundler/config file which had a setting for the bundle directory  pointing to calendar_date_select (what? how'd that happen?) and deleted it and was able to update the gem bundle and start the server under the new mongrel.

As soon as I hit the app with the web browser I got the error. Ok, so maybe this mongrel version isn't compatible so I reverted back to 1.1.5 and the problem still persists. Aside from the original issue it was all working before using rvm so I figure there must be something I've done wrong and there may be a bug as well. I'm stumped!

The entire exception is below. 

Thanks,

Chris

      <body>Well, I'm not sure why that worked but it did. To my knowledge I'm not using cookies as I use db session store. What cookie is Rails 3 storing?

Now that's that out of the way I can try and tackle why my dev environment is taking 10 seconds to return any response from my local mongrel, or webrick and I even tried passenger. Nothing appears in the log at all until 10 seconds later.

My app is updated from 2.3.8 so I'm at a loss as what could be causing this huge delay. Is it really ruby 1.8.7?

Thanks!</body>
