  <original-body>I've been developing a Rails application, the sole purpose of which is to act as a REST API, sending and receiving JSON or XML.

Along the way, numerous discrepancies between to_json and to_xml have popped up which have proved to be a royal pain in the arse:

1. to_xml misrepresents the other_ids result (included using the 'methods' option) as a concatenated string, when it should in fact be an array of ids. to_json gets this right.

2. to_xml accepts the dasherize =&gt; true option. to_json does not.

I'm not yet familiar enough with the Rails source to provide an acceptable patch, but I would like to contribute in so far as at least providing this feedback.</original-body>

      <body>Is dasherize useful for json ? I can't think you would ever want that since it means that you have to access things as x['foo-bar'] since x.foo-bar is obviously invalid (or rather doesn't mean x['foo-bar'])

If you're interested in playing around the appropriate files are active_record/lib/serialization.rb, active_record/lib/serializers/json_serializer.rb, active_record/lib/serializers/xml_serializer.rb</body>
