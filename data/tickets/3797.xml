  <original-body>As I understand it, this may still be a work in progress. Raising a ticket anyway in case it isn't.

I have an engine located in vendor/plugins/train in an edge application. This `train` application is a clone of the edge application with application.rb modified so the `Application` class in it descends from `Rails::Engine` instead of `Rails::Application` and I have an _init.rb_ file which requires this _config/application.rb_ file. The reasoning for this last part is that before hand it was complaining of a `uninitialized constant Train`. _config/application.rb_ loads this constant, so I thought this would be a quick&amp;easy workaround to try and play with engines.

Alas, I get this error &quot;train&quot; is a Railtie/Engine and cannot be installed as plugin&quot;.

I do not know where engines are supposed to go apart from vendor/plugins. So what's up with this?</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
