  <original-body>Hi,

This is just a small update to the docs for Time.zone=.

Even though Time.zone is thread-local, it will leak across requests within the same thread if you handle one request with a logged-in user and the next request with a logged-out user.

This little change updates the sample code to use an around_filter instead of a before_filter to show how to fix this.

P.S. You might be tempted to combine the first two lines of set_time_zone into one line with the comma assignment syntax and add &quot;if logged_in? to the one line in the ensure clause. Don't do it. If you did that, the user's time zone would leak out to the next request when the user logs out.</original-body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
