  <original-body>I've been trying to get the FormBuilder variant of fields_for to work for a few weeks now, but I can't seem to find what I feel to be the correct solution, and I think there may be a bug preventing me from realizing my goal.

If I create a form for a model, where the controller has already set the instance variable:

  @user = User.new # (or current_user for an edit)

Then the view has (I'll leave out tags):

  form_for :user, :url =&gt; user_url(@user), :html =&gt; { :method =&gt; :put, :multipart =&gt; true } do |f|

Now I add a nested model (Contact).  And let's say that @user.contact doesn't exist yet since we are in the 'new' controller.
Then the view would also have:

    f.fields_for :contact do |cf|
      # and then maybe...
      cf.error_messages

However, when I do this, I receive the error:

`@user[contact]' is not allowed as an instance variable name

If, however, I instead explicitly create @user.contact = Contact.new in the users_controller.new, and then write the above fields_for like this:

    f.fields_for @user.contact do |cf|

Then everything works just fine.  (I do have to create @user.contact or I receive another error pertaining to 'user[nil_value]' not being valid)

The weird thing is, that I debugged a bit, and found that the object_name which is being passed to eventually give the error above is equal to 'user[contact]' in BOTH cases.  So somehow, the instance variable name is only not allowed if the variable (@user.contact) has not been instantiated?

This doesn't seem right.  If there is in fact a way of doing this differently and correctly to make it work, then I feel that the documentation should be updated to include using FormBuilder.fields_for differently than the normal fields_for.</original-body>

      <body>Glenn,

This is currently expected although of course frustrating. Some work is being done &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e0750d6a5c7f621e4ca12205137c0b135cab444a&quot;&gt;in edge&lt;/a&gt; to alleviate this issue.

There is a discussion going on in &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/msg/89ee8610e246f826&quot;&gt;rails-core&lt;/a&gt; about this, too.</body>

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as their   handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

      <body-html>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were
inspired by baseball glove design and they created discount
handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come
along until years later. The original handbag collection had twelve
designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,
and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we
still expect today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought
new looks to Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic
materials like jersey and wool. She created the brass hardware that
is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
When Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the
next level, and they became a name known the world over. Affordable
luxury was not a concept that many people knew, but now they would.
Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they came out with a catalog,
and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought
its brand relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in
1988, and also expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts

      <body-html>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to
wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with
getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&quot;&gt;ugg classic crochet
Tall&amp;#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few
years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is
because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&amp;#8217;s
Favorite Things show.&lt;br&gt;
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic
collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers
(polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra
comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=&quot;http:&quot;&gt;ugg classic crochet is
well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new
decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic
Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to
personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the
Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed
down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does
not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are
worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about
yourself. Today&amp;#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They
are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has
become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most
important factors that will decide success in various areas of
life. It can boost up your confidence level.&lt;br&gt;
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=&quot;http:&quot;&gt;uggs for cheapCrochet Tall
boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because
Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only
does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum
raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because
she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears
them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</body-html>
