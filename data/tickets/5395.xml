  <original-body>I was looking at this post on Rails Forum:
http://railsforum.com/viewtopic.php?id=28447

And tried to create something more simple. The best I came was to rename the text_field's name property, so my &quot;task&quot; partial was:

    &lt;%= f.hidden_field :id, :name =&gt; 'project[tasks_attributes][][id]' %&gt;
    &lt;%= f.label :name %&gt;
    &lt;%= f.text_field :name, :size =&gt; 15, :name =&gt; 'project[tasks_attributes][][name]' %&gt;

It works as a charm. On older versions of Rails, if I named an input like 'project[][name]' the result would be a little strange, but right now it sends an array of hashes, as one would expect.

I uploaded the example code to my github: http://github.com/mauricioszabo/Nested-Forms-example. I think that it would make more sense to generate HTML like:
@@@
  &lt;input id=&quot;project_tasks_attributes_0_name&quot; name=&quot;project[tasks_attributes][][name]&quot; size=&quot;15&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
@@@
Than to generate
@@@
  &lt;input id=&quot;project_tasks_attributes_0_name&quot; name=&quot;project[tasks_attributes][0][name]&quot; size=&quot;15&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
@@@
Because it have the same functionality, clutters less the code, it's more flexible to adapt (I just need to generate a static for the text_field, don't need to create a &quot;fake unique ID&quot;), and, right now, it doesn't need any changes on the model part, just on the Form Helper.</original-body>

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
