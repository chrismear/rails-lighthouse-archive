  <original-body>Hi,

I am trying to send a generated CSV file by e-mail as an attachment. The contents of this file are utf-8.

ActionMailer is clever enough to render the contents to Base64, but the charset is not set in the headers, which gives grave pain in trying to open or save the file.

I've tried to set the content-type as &quot;text/csv; charset=utf-8&quot; but the &quot;; charset=utf-8&quot; part is neatly gsub'ed of somewhere. When I set the a charset on the attachment (see code below) it is kindly ignored, leading my e-mail client (and the programs thereafter) to believe that the content is latin-1 (or ascii at best)

@@@ ruby
attachment &quot;text/csv; charset=utf-8&quot; do |a|
  a.filename = &quot;my_lengthy_filename.csv&quot;
  a.body     = File.read(csv_file)

  # even this is ignored
  a.charset  = &quot;utf-8&quot;
end
@@@

It turns out that actionmailer bluntly kills the charset for attachments. This is wrong for text/* type attachments, afaic. And when adding the attachment as a part, the charset is set, but the filename is removed (good behaviour).

I have attached a rather blunt patch that fixes the problem correctly.


PS: This was accidentally posted in Guides before (see: https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/16213/tickets/152-actionmailer-attachment-character-set-is-not-set#ticket-152-1).</original-body>
