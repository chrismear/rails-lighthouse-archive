  <original-body>Hi there,

I just had a problem where we had a text/html message template, identified by its filename extension, as the only part of the message. ActionMailer sent the message as multipart/alternative anyway.

For some reason, this caused Yahoo! Mail to render the HTML part as if it were text. Clearly, this is wrong, but ActionMailer's behavior is also kind of strange. Don't attach to the root message if there is no need.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
