At a minimum, a comment that KCODE='UTF-8' is presumed would be in order, use of the value of 'expression' makes sense, and there are builtin functions which will do the iteration in a way that likely will be faster on both MRI and on other Ruby implementations.

Actually the code also works when $KCODE is set to 'SJIS' so a better comment would be: &quot;Splits the string on character boundaries, which are determined based on $KCODE.&quot;</body>

      <body>I assume that smaller numbers are better in those benchmarks?

If so, this change does not produce a regression in performance, and doesn't have much effect on sustained calls on short strings.  But in all cases, the performance effect is an improvement (again, presuming that I'm reading this correctly), and in some cases a noticeable one (on the order of 20%).

And, yes your comment is much better than the one I proposed.  Rereading the rdocs on String#split, it does say characters, so perhaps a comment is not needed at all (I would still argue that this is not obvious, but perhaps that's just because it caught me).</body>

      <body>&gt; I assume that smaller numbers are better in those benchmarks?

Ah yes, I must have been spacing when I posted the benchmarks, sorry about that. It's total runtime for User, System, Total (Wall clock). Top two rows are for the clean method and bottom two rows are for the verify method.

So you can read it as 10% to 40% faster for short strings. Currently the cleanup method is only used in Rails to clean up attribute values, we can assume most string will be relatively short.

&gt; I would still argue that this is not obvious, but perhaps that's just because it caught me.

I don't think many people know that regular expressions changes depending on how you set $KCODE, so it's rather esoteric and should probably be commented on.

Michael, can you commit this if you approve?</body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious.
