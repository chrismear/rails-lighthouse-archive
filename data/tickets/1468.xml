  <original-body>If the first character in an ERB template file is a '%' the first sentence no longer gets recognized as inline Ruby in Rails 2.2.2 (in Rails 2.1.2 it was correctly interpreted).

My guess is that Rails prepends something to a template file so that Erb no longer recognizes the first character as the first character. Adding a newline before it, or changing the line to the &lt;%   %&gt; form fixes it. So the bug only appears when Erb is configured to recognize % as the first character with: config.action_view.erb_trim_mode = &quot;-%&quot;

I have many templates starting with: % @title = &quot;...&quot;, as is not uncommon, and this was a very hard bug to find. so it would be great if this could get fixed.</original-body>
