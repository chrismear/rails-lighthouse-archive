Subject: [PATCH] In commit 704f2cc6dee9d55d19bfad8e4a8308fdee71bf6f a couple of lines of code were adding with the following comment: "Replacing logger work around for mocha bug. Should be fixed in mocha 0.3.3". Since the Rails Gemfile now specifies Mocha >= 0.9.8 and since the ActionMailer tests still pass when these lines are removed, it seems sensible to remove them.
