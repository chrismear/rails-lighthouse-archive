  <original-body>I put this code in my controller's action

    cookies[:name] = {
        :value   =&gt; &quot;test&quot; ,
         :expires =&gt; 2.hours.from_now
        }

and i found out that the cookies cann't be saved. My browser is IE8 on win7, rails version is 3.0.1&#12290;
I test this with rails 2.3.9, and cookies can be saved.
By the way, i found out that in rails 2.3.9 if without passing the :expires key, the cookies cann't be saved yet.
Is there any information about how to set cookies? I googled for a couples of hours, and have no idea now.
Thanks for your help</original-body>

      <body>I have tested this issue under several environments
1. Windows7 rails3 IE8, cookies can be saved: No
2. Windows7 rails 2.3.9, cookies can be saved: Yes

3.WindowsXP rails3 IE6, cookies can be saved: No
4.WindowsXP rails 2.3.9, cookies can be saved: Yes

5.Ubuntu 10.04 rails3 Firefox on Ubuntu &amp;&amp; IE8 on Windows7, cookies can be saved: Yes
6.Ubuntu 10.04 rails2.3.9 Firefox on Ubuntu &amp;&amp; IE8 on Windows7, cookies can be saved: Yes

After several testings, i can make a conclusion now.
When rails3 app is deployed on *nix system the cookies can be saved with IE or Firefox
When rails3 app is deployed on Windows the cookies cann't be saved with IE or Firefox

It seems rails3 app deployed on Windows doesn't send cookies to the browsers client
in the mean while rails 2.3.9 app deployed on Windwos does.
I think it's a bug of rails3 on Windows.
This issue has bothered me for a whole day, and really made me a headache...</body>

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment.

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
