      <body>@robert 

i had tried to do labels with I18n from http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2010/02/rails-3-i18n-changes/
but this way doesn`t work

i found answer.
'action_view/helpers/form_helper.rb' lines 890

@@@ ruby
            p &quot;#{object_name}.#{method_name}&quot; # me puts here
            I18n.t(&quot;helpers.label.#{object_name}.#{method_name}&quot;, :default =&gt; &quot;&quot;).presence


return &quot;hotels_period.name&quot;

@@@

so in locales yml, keys must be like : 

pl:
  helpers:
    label:
      hotels_period:
        name:                  'nazwa'

not 

      hotels:
        period:
          name:                  'nazwa'


its just another inconsistence ?</body>
