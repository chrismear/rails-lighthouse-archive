  <original-body>Since 2.3.2.1 have been trying out various methods to get sinatra embedded in app/metal to reload when the file is changed. As far as i can tell (please correct me), but the rack middleware in app/metal is never checked or reloaded by rails (development mode).

An alternative there is the rerun gem. However although rerun will detect any changed .rb file in app/metal, it will restart all of rails. Code reloading in rack is reportedly a complex issue however getting it working for metal might be a worthwhile for rails 2-3-branch. If we could get a way to reload only the affected middlewares, and not the whole of rails stack that would be awesome and a real time saver. 

Resources: 
There is roman's monkey-patch here http://roman.flucti.com/reloading-rails-metal-applications. This is probably a good place to start. Also the rails-dev-boost at http://github.com/dtrueman/rails-dev-boost/tree/master might be a good place to try things out. I've yet to look at the code on this, just touching base here. If you are indeed affected by these reloading issues then please add a +1 here.

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as their   handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that don't have   this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to style and   pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold loafers to slingbacks   with open toes. You may be able to find Coach shoes at discount prices online,   but be sure that you are buying genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous, Coach   shoes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chanelpursesbags.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chanel purses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can do that well. Coach sneakers and heels will make you   feel sporty, too. When selecting pumps or sandals to wear, you'll be happy to   count on the long-standing quality and service of the Coach company. They have   many styles to choose from, including chic and glamorous Coach boots and Coach   heels. Whether you are looking for sports shoes like Coach sneakers or sexy   shoes like Coach boots, the Coach name will never let you down.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.

Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin).
