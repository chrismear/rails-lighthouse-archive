  <original-body>I just made a patch (see attached) so you can cancel an ActionMailer delivery by raising CancelDelivery (with an optional message, that is logged) in an ActionMailer method.

I've had use for this myself on a project where we checked for bounced mail and stopped mailing people after too many bounces. It was a better fit to put logic in our mail setup method than in every single controller or callback where mails were being generated.

I've also seen it requested at least once :p http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/112329

The attached file is a formatted Git patch with tests and documentation.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
