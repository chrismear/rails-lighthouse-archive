+h3. Forms to external resources
+
+If you need to post some data to an external resource it is still great to build your from using rails form helpers. But sometimes you need to set an +authenticity_token+ for this resource. You can do it by passing an +:authenticity_token => 'your_external_token'+ parameter to the +form_tag+ options:
+
+<erb>
+<%= form_tag 'http://farfar.away/form', :authenticity_token => 'external_token') do %>
+  Form contents
+<% end %>
+</erb>
+
+Sometimes when you submit data to an external resource, like payment gateway, fields you can use in your form are limited by an external API. So you may want not to generate an +authenticity_token+ hidden field at all. For doing this just pass +false+ to the +:authenticity_token+ option:
+
+<erb>
+<%= form_tag 'http://farfar.away/form', :authenticity_token => 'external_token') do %>
+  Form contents
+<% end %>
+</erb>
+
+The same technique is available for the +form_for+ too. You need just to set an +authenticity_token+ through +html+ options:
+
+<erb>
+<%= form_for @invoice, :url => external_url, :html => { :authenticity_token => 'external_token' } do |f|
+  Form contents
+<% end %>
+</erb>
+
+Or if you don't want to render an +authenticity_token+ field:
+
+<erb>
+<%= form_for @invoice, :url => external_url, :html => { :authenticity_token => false } do |f|
+  Form contents
+<% end %>
+</erb>

 h3. Building Complex Forms
 
 Many apps grow beyond simple forms editing a single object. For example when creating a Person you might want to allow the user to (on the same form) create multiple address records (home, work, etc.). When later editing that person the user should be able to add, remove or amend addresses as necessary. While this guide has shown you all the pieces necessary to handle this, Rails does not yet have a standard end-to-end way of accomplishing this, but many have come up with viable approaches. These include:
