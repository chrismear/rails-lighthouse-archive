  <original-body>Hello, we are trying to freeze our rails app to v2.3.5 and we are running this command:

rake rails:freeze:edge RELEASE=2.3.5

But it is failing trying to download the zip from dev.rubyonrails.org (which appears to be down):

Downloading Rails from http://dev.rubyonrails.org/archives/rails_2.3.5.zip
rake aborted!
Connection reset by peer

Is there some way to pass a new host to download the archive or are we going about this the wrong way?  Any help would be appreciated, this is on a new host on a production environment and we are suffering with the wrong version of rails.

Thanks so much.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
