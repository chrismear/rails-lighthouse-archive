  <original-body>The following model setup is being used: http://gist.github.com/458559
The Admin::Candidate version of the model is an enhanced version which is only loaded when the user is an admin.

It is not possible to set accepts_nested_attributes_for to the child model when the parent has it too.

In activerecord/lib/active_record/nested_attributes.rb:251 a delete_method is performed for a method that is not defined in that class, although method_defined? says it is. I think the old behaviour of simply overwriting the method is good enough. This very same construction worked in rails 2.3 just fine.</original-body>

      <body>To follow up on this:
If you only add accepts_nested_attributes to the child model it won't work properly either.
At the time the check for autosave is performed on the reflection it is nil. Not because it is being reset, but because it reads the reflection settings of its parents.

I hope I am clear. I am also not sure if this needs to be in this same ticket, otherwise I will create a new one when I have more time.</body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
