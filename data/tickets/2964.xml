  <original-body>Hey guys,
I was having a look at the the &quot;find (ActiveRecord::Base)&quot; action. Under paramters -&gt; :select it is stated:

:select - By default, this is &quot;*&quot; as in &quot;SELECT * FROM&quot;, but can be changed if you, for example, want to do a join but not include the joined columns. Takes a string with the SELECT SQL fragment (e.g. &quot;id, name&quot;).

I used this method earlier today on a model together with some joins and found that the default when used on a model is &quot;Model.*&quot; and therefore doesn't include joined columns by default. I had to add a :select =&gt; &quot;*&quot; to get to these.

I think the API should state this for clarity.

Thanks,
Julian

PS: first ticket here -&gt; feel free to correct me if I do something wrong</original-body>
