  <original-body>ActiveRecord performs increasingly poorly as the result set size increases in 3.0.0.rc.

I get this strace output at least once (if not more) for every object in the result (ChildA is the AR class):

rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 0

      <body>A lot of work has been done by Aaron Patterson with regards to AR performance both before and after 3.0 release. There has been a lot of improvements in performance.

Marking ticket as resolved. In case the above issue is still happening in 3.0 or 3-0-stable branch or even master just leave a comment and I'll reopen it.</body>
