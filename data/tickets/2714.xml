  <original-body>500.html is actually an ERB template: it instructs the reader to read the appropriate log file to find out what went wrong, in case he's the administrator. This is good for usability because apparently a lot of people don't know that they're supposed to read the log file.

The Rescue middleware correctly renders 500.html as ERB, but the Failsafe middleware does not. This patch solves the problem, and also adds unit tests for Failsafe. It also makes the default static Failsafe response (which is returned in case ERB rendering fails as well) more friendly.

This patch is for Rails 2.3.</original-body>
