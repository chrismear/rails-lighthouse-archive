  <original-body>Hello,

I don't even know if I am in the right place to send my problems and question; if I am not, please direct me to a site that can help me. I have already been to GetSatisfaction (of which I got none...satisfaction) and numerous other forums and sites.

My problem is that I can't open the links in ANY of my emails...none, nada, zip, zilch. I have to copy and paste and that is very time consuming. I spend almost 6 hrs a day trying to find a solution to this, as well as the numerous other problems I have had with TB.

For instance, one day my &quot;folders' and all of the information that I saved in them are gone! Big surprise when I went to look something up in my folders that was there the day before only to find that now it was gone, gone, gone.

Can you help me where I can retrieve the lost info in my folders? Or how to open the links in my emails? If not, can you suggest a site where I can find this info. I have already been to numerous sites/forums including GetSatisfaction and I can't get an answer that makes sense to me.

Thank you.

Blessings.
