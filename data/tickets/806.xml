  <original-body>I just realized that the include field is completely ignored in the
2.1.0 version.  I need to use a function that creates an array loops
through the columns in the table to find the search strings and
apparently it's not working with this new version. Anyone with a work
around? This is my query.


@furnii_from_furnii = Furni.find :all, :include =&gt;[:raider, {:imageasset
=&gt; :skin} ], :conditions =&gt; &quot;&quot;+Furni.conditions_by_like(@search)+&quot; OR &quot;
+Raider.conditions_by_like(@search) + &quot;OR&quot;
+Skin.conditions_by_like(@search) + &quot;&quot;</original-body>

      <body>:include certainly should not be ignored, but it is possible that due to no conditions referencing any of the included tables the query is not executed as a join but instead as multiple selects (using the new &quot;preload&quot; strategy of eager loading). Either way this ticket provides too little information to work with, so closing it for now.</body>
