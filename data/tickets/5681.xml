  <original-body>TMail has a vendored version of rchardet 1.3.
It's impossible for a Rails 2 application to use a newer version of rchardet: no matter how I tried to load a different one, the one in ActionMailer is called anyway.
I tried specifying one as a gem in environment.rb and using either a vendored or non-vendored gem. I also tried rcharder in vendor/plugins.

This is particularly problematic because rchardet 1.3 does not work with Ruby 1.9.2, throwing exception in at least a couple of spots.
In fact, the only fork I could find that seems to work with Ruby 1.9.2 is http://github.com/kijun/rchardet.git

Unfortunately I don't have a fix or workaround to propose.</original-body>
