  <original-body>The packaged JavaScript libraries - Prototype and script.aculo.us - which are currently bundled with Rails are provided in their full, uncompressed, &quot;development&quot; versions:

* controls.js (34716B)
* dragdrop.js (31103B)
* effects.js (38675B)
* prototype.js (129738B)

(4 JS files weighing in at 234kB, as of Rails 2.2.2, Prototype 1.6.0.3)

Using the freely available [Yahoo! YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) with its default settings, the same 4 files become:

* controls.js (21542B)
* dragdrop.js (19256B)
* effects.js (24677B)
* prototype.js (74956B)

(4 JS files weighing in at 140kB)

That's about a **40% reduction** in file size with supposedly no changes to functionality.

I realize that applications should probably ultimately be moving toward hosted libraries (using [Google AJAX Libraries API](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlibs/), for example), but as long as the Rails framework is bundling libraries, shouldn't we try to lessen their impact as much as possible?  Further, I'd argue that the uncompressed versions of those libraries are not necessary to provide with the Rails framework at all, as we HIGHLY encourage people to not modify those files directly.  In fact, each new release of Rails seems to overwrite those files with the latest JS framework version, so we instead endorse using a `application.js` to add any custom functionality that may be required.

This seems like a relatively simple change that has a large, positive application performance impact.

      <body>On the other side:

&quot;Minifying&quot; is not the right solution for bandwidth issues. In my opinion it is responsibility of server that is hosting the app to compress its output.

Also the reduction of 40% takes place only in these javascripts, so overall reduction (including html/css/images/etc.) is far worse.

I'd like to be able to just **read** this code. It saves me sometimes.</body>

      <body>Fair enough.  I was chatting with someone in `#rails-contrib` last night who had the same thoughts.  I guess I just rely more heavily on the API documentation than reading the actual source and assume that the packaged libraries are working and bug-free. :)

I  guess the better solution would be to encourage people to tie in the YUI Compressor (or some other solution) with a capistrano deployment or continue to push the Google AJAX API. 

Thanks for the feedback on it.</body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
