  <original-body>I hope this looks okay, preview is busted.

Original ticket here: http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/7979

Summary from original:

I'm using the following date_select in a view:

@@@ ruby
date_select('project', 'start_at',
  :end_year =&gt; 1980, :start_year =&gt;Date.today.year,
  :discard_day =&gt; true,
  :include_blank =&gt; true,
  :order =&gt; [:month, :year])
@@@

However, when selecting the blank (:include_blank) option, the date is not typecast to NULL as it should be - rather, it is set to 2001 (for some reason).

A debug() of params[:project] reveals that the :discard_day option causes rails to set the start_at(3i) param to &quot;1&quot;, which then causes the entire date to not be recognized as a nil submission. 

Original comment:

&gt; This appears to happen when start_at was set already somewhere in the code. For instance by a default value or by assignment triggered on the previous request. Because start_at was already set, the helper will set the day value of start_at to 1 to make sure that whatever month or year is chosen, it will be a valid date. This is normally a good assumption, but not when you want to allow blank.

&gt; When these values eventually end up in ActiveRecord the automated type casting on multiparameter assign ends up calling Time.local(1) to set start_at. Which happens to be Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 +0100 2001. So it interprets the day value as a year value. This causes two problems; ActiveRecord can't do validation on the time anymore, but it also uses the parameter for the wrong argument.</original-body>

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as their   handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that don't have   this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to style and   pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold loafers to slingbacks   with open toes. You may be able to find Coach shoes at discount prices online,   but be sure that you are buying genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous, Coach   shoes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chanelpursesbags.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chanel purses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can do that well. Coach sneakers and heels will make you   feel sporty, too. When selecting pumps or sandals to wear, you'll be happy to   count on the long-standing quality and service of the Coach company. They have   many styles to choose from, including chic and glamorous Coach boots and Coach   heels. Whether you are looking for sports shoes like Coach sneakers or sexy   shoes like Coach boots, the Coach name will never let you down.&lt;/p&gt;</body>
      <body-html>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were
inspired by baseball glove design and they created discount
handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come
along until years later. The original handbag collection had twelve
designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,
and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we
still expect today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought
new looks to Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic
materials like jersey and wool. She created the brass hardware that
is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
When Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the
next level, and they became a name known the world over. Affordable
luxury was not a concept that many people knew, but now they would.
Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they came out with a catalog,
and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought
its brand relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in
1988, and also expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts
among the leading purchasers of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach
heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid 90's, and
Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put
Coach heels and &lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags
outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as
their handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their
purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that
don't have this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans
outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to
style and pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold
loafers to slingbacks with open toes. You may be able to find Coach
shoes at discount prices online, but be sure that you are buying
genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler
jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous,
Coach shoes and &lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.chanelpursesbags.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chanel
purses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can do that well. Coach sneakers and heels will
make you feel sporty, too. When selecting pumps or sandals to wear,
you'll be happy to count on the long-standing quality and service
of the Coach company. They have many styles to choose from,
including chic and glamorous Coach boots and Coach heels. Whether
you are looking for sports shoes like Coach sneakers or sexy shoes
like Coach boots, the Coach name will never let you down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</body-html>
