      <body>I've figured it out. It was caused by the fix for ticket #528. This fix tries to determine which tables you have explicitly joined so that you can force preloading (instead of regular eager loading) if you want to. The problem is that it does a bad job of this since it will also pick up tables named in the join condition. In my case and the case above, this table has to be explicitly named to prevent ambiguity. As far as I can see, it can only be resolved by replacing the somewhat nasty regex with an even nastier one.

/([\.a-zA-Z_]+).?\./

Becomes...

/\bJOIN\s+[&quot;`]?([\.a-zA-Z_]+)[&quot;`]?\s/i

This could possibly be improved. Here's a patch against 2-3-stable anyway. I may add tests and a patch for master later. Really tired right now. :(</body>

      <body>Does someone familiar with several databases want to comment on whether joins always look like this (seems to me like they do but databases never cease to surprise me)? I seem to recall the some database uses [] to quote table names - i think the existing regexes just use . as a catchall

Other than that looks fine.

Separate from this, you should avoid all this if you use the form of joins where you name associations (since then rails doesn't have to parse a blob of sql to work out what is being joined</body>

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
