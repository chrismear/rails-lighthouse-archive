  <original-body>Just moved from 2.3.5 to 2.3.8 and suddenly whenever I try to access a model called task I get:

undefined method `quoted_table_name' for Rake::Task:Class

I set the referencing class to be use :class_name =&gt; '::Task' and then got

WARNING: Deprecated reference to top-level constant 'Task' found at: /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rake-0.8.7/lib/rake.rb:2470:in `rakefile_location'

I think the order that things are being loaded is preventing Ruby from autoloading the task model, or there's some overzealous class paranoia in Rake now. If I explicitly load task.rb then it works in the console.

The class that has tasks associated with it works if you load task.rb, which is what I've done to get around it.

Not sure if this is also in 3.x because not using it yet.</original-body>

      <body>This has happened to me in the past when loading a gem or plugin that requires rake.  For example [whenever](http://github.com/javan/whenever/blob/master/lib/whenever.rb).

If you are using bundler, you may have to add :require =&gt; false, then manually require that gem after the rails initializer block in environment.rb.

I'd check your gems / plugins first, and make sure none are requiring rake as the next debugging step.</body>

      <body>It went away when I switched back to 2.3.5 and I haven't been chasing it since.

I've just dug through my git repo back to where I switched back and the problem isn't showing - must be some environmental thing that's been fixed since.

If I cant show you you can't look at it.

For the record, a fragment had many tasks and it was initialising fragments that caused the problem, looked like they hadn't been loaded, and when it was trying to load them it was finding the rake class first.

So you may as well close the log unless you can get it to choke with a new 2.3.5 and no later installs.

Currently running rake 0.8.7, which may be why it's working now.

Thank you.</body>

      <body>Quoting http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/reservedwords

&gt; The errors that occur when you use a reserved word tend to be very confusing. Things that 
&gt; you think are happening in your code, are actually happening somewhere in the framework. 
&gt; Sometimes you can look at the stack trace and see that its not going through your class, 
&gt; but through some framework class. If you have an error that makes no sense at all, I would 
&gt; check to make sure you don&#8217;t have a name that conflicts with the above list.

I'm going to close this ticket, but if anybody still feels this needs to be patched or the issue is something else just make a comment and I'll reopen.</body>

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as their   handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that don't have   this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to style and   pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold loafers to slingbacks   with open toes. You may be able to find Coach shoes at discount prices online,   but be sure that you are buying genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous, Coach   shoes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chanelpursesbags.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chanel purses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can do that well. Coach sneakers and heels will make you   feel sporty, too. When selecting pumps or sandals to wear, you'll be happy to   count on the long-standing quality and service of the Coach company. They have   many styles to choose from, including chic and glamorous Coach boots and Coach   heels. Whether you are looking for sports shoes like Coach sneakers or sexy   shoes like Coach boots, the Coach name will never let you down.&lt;/p&gt;</body>
