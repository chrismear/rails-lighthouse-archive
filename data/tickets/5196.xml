  <original-body>When you do delete_all in association, it does one SELECT query to get all IDs (primary key) to delete and another query deleting all retrieved IDs. This could be one single query.

Besides, this has an issue with join tables, because they don't have primary keys, so all IDs returned are simply NULL (making the query more verbose and shower than it should).

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
