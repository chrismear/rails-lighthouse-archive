  <original-body>As discussed [here](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core/browse_thread/thread/949319f5ecf0fcef?hl=en &quot;Google Group discussion&quot;) I'm attaching a patch which overrides #initialize_copy rather than #clone in order to implement cloning of AR objects. This will allow AR classes to implement deep cloning of attributes much more easily, for example:

@@@ ruby
  def initialize_copy(other)
    super
    self.an_association = other.an_association
  end
@@@

This patch isn't intended to be the finished article as I have two particular points on which I'd appreciate some feedback.

Firstly, I'm having to call the after_initialize callback near the top of #initialize_copy in order to get the test suite to pass. This doesn't seem right to me and I've documented my thoughts in the patch file. 

Secondly, #initialize allows a block to be passed in. Should #initialize_copy do a similar thing? If so I'll add a test and relevant code.</original-body>

      <body>(from [6361d4234ca7f7c2dcb98e6ed34187d2933b56d7]) Call initialize_copy when cloning [#3164 state:resolved]

Cloned AR objects are now instantiated through initialize_copy rather than
new/initialize. This allows AR classes to override initialize_copy in order to
implement deep cloning.

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as their   handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that don't have   this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to style and   pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold loafers to slingbacks   with open toes. You may be able to find Coach shoes at discount prices online,   but be sure that you are buying genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous, Coach   shoes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chanelpursesbags.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chanel purses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can do that well.

      <body-html>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were
inspired by baseball glove design and they created discount
handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come
along until years later. The original handbag collection had twelve
designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,
and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we
still expect today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought
new looks to Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic
materials like jersey and wool. She created the brass hardware that
is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
When Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the
next level, and they became a name known the world over. Affordable
luxury was not a concept that many people knew, but now they would.
Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they came out with a catalog,
and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought
its brand relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in
1988, and also expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts
among the leading purchasers of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach
heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid 90's, and
Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put
Coach heels and &lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags
outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as
their handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their
purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that
don't have this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans
outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to
style and pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold
loafers to slingbacks with open toes. You may be able to find Coach
shoes at discount prices online, but be sure that you are buying
genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler
jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous,
Coach shoes and &lt;a href=
