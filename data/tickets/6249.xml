  <original-body>Given a has_many relationship with :dependent =&gt; :restrict and a not null constraint on the foreign key, a call to association.delete_all will fail.

The problem is to do with has_many_association#delete_records.  It includes a case statement that looks at the parent models :dependent option but does not handle the :restrict case, it instead tries to do the :nullify case and tries to set the foreign key to null when it should just delete the records.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
