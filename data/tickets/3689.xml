  <original-body>I've got a situation where I have a model which has an observer, I'm using the accepts_nested_attributes_for method to allow the model to save its associated children in the form. When the observer runs I'm not getting the after_create callback fired but rather the after_update callback, which explodes fantastically.

I've written a test case to demonstrate this behaviour and it looks like the update is being done before the create. The test result is the following

      <body>I believe I've managed to determine the cause for this. Using the classes from the provided test as an example when we do the following

@@@ ruby
bunny = Bunny.new({:name =&gt; &quot;foo&quot;, carrot_attributes =&gt; [{:rating =&gt; 0.2}]})
bunny.save
@@@

what happens is the following

1. The Bunny instance is persisted to the database
2. The Carrot instance on bunny is persisted to the database, either as part of the create or an early after_save callback
3. The belongs_to_touch_after_save_or_destroy_for_bunny Carrot after_save callback is run
4. belongs_to_touch_after_save_or_destroy_for_bunny calls save! on the bunny object
5. bunny.save! as the object has been persisted to the database performs an UPDATE of the database
6. The BunnyObserver is notified of an UPDATE having occurred and runs its after_update and after_save callbacks
7. The adding of the Carrot instance to the Bunny returns
8. The Bunny instance save method which is creating the object runs its after_* callbacks
9. The BunnyObserver is notified of an INSERT having occurred and runs its after_create and after_save callbacks

So the call sequence is logical with this understanding, however my expectation for the observer call sequence is different from the resulting sequence.</body>

its a bit of a hack with an aroma of roquefort but it is at the very least working and would seem to function in both Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9.

If any better solutions or fixes can be offered then I'd be happy to add a better aroma to my code.</body>

These &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are culturally engaging and allow for the woman   wearing them to be enveloped in luxury.With new cuts and styles and hand stitched shoes, these &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, heels or flats will make every foot look like it stepped out of vintage Hollywood. This   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; have been worn and coveted by many of the most famous females in   recent history. One such &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Jennifer Aniston, wears them in public and at   home.This company makes many different unique styles of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from ankle booties   to sandals, pumps, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, platforms and wedges. One &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in particular is ideal   for the gothic style sense; it is patent leather and laces up the front of the   shaft. There are also zippers on each side, and this shoe offers a flat heel of   a half inch.Another great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets sale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is featured in People's Style Watch and is called a   platform bootie. This &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ture religion jeans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a raised panel in front of the ankle as well as   a heel that measures 4.5 inches.

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map. Their shoes aren't as popular as their   handbags, but they are well worth the money invested in their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women love heels, but at times you may want to wear shoes that don't have   this height. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truereligionjeans-outlet.com&quot;&gt;true religion jeans outlet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are as dedicated to comfort as they are to style and   pizzazz. Coach platforms come in many styles, from gold loafers to slingbacks   with open toes. You may be able to find Coach shoes at discount prices online,   but be sure that you are buying genuine Coach products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenmonclerjackets.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moncler jackets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that will make you feel and look glamorous, Coach   shoes and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chanelpursesbags.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chanel purses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can do that well. Coach sneakers and heels will make you   feel sporty, too. When selecting pumps or sandals to wear, you'll be happy to   count on the long-standing quality and service of the Coach company. They have   many styles to choose from, including chic and glamorous Coach boots and Coach   heels. Whether you are looking for sports shoes like Coach sneakers or sexy   shoes like Coach boots, the Coach name will never let you down.&lt;/p&gt;</body>
