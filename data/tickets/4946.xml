  <original-body>Hello, consider code http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/53c13f1acaa2eb05e7f418b53f6156a4f5a773e0/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/kernel/reporting.rb#L39 running in a Ruby VM with support for multiple threads. It is possible that following happens

thread 1: old_stream = stream.dup
thread 1: stream.reopen('/dev/null')
thread 2: old_stream = stream.dup
thread 2: stream.reopen('/dev/null')
thread 1: stream.reopen(old_stream)
thread 2: stream.reopen(old_stream)

This results in stdout bein permanently set to /dev/null, instead of being set to something usual. In JRuby, in turn, this leads to a cascade of other bad behaviour (somehow, the output buffer overruns and then every &quot;puts&quot; yields an exceptiopn).

In general, every access to &quot;reopen&quot; should be carefully reviewed.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
