  <original-body>As far as I've seen, the case_sensitive_equality_operator is in rails 2.2 bound to the connection adapter. But why is the more expensive case insensitve case not handled in a connection adapter bound way?
On mysql an complete table-scan will run if someone compares by using lower(&lt;column&gt;) = &lt;value&gt;. The result would be the same, if not using lower... in my freezed checkout of rails 1.x there was a comment, that this is anyway only needed by sqlite.. so why don't write a adapter specific method here as well?
I had a lot of trouble on my project, searching for the bottleneck, until I found this out...</original-body>
