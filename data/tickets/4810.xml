in rails 3.0beta3, it works OK and will responde with params[:format]

      <body>&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were inspired by   baseball glove design and they created discount handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come along until years later. The original handbag collection   had twelve designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,   and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we still expect   today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought new looks to   Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic materials like jersey and   wool. She created the brass hardware that is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. When   Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the next level, and they   became a name known the world over. Affordable luxury was not a concept that   many people knew, but now they would. Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they   came out with a catalog, and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought its brand   relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in 1988, and also   expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts among the leading purchasers   of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid   90's, and Reed Krakoff, the lead designer, loaned his talents to help put Coach   heels and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.louisvuittonbagoutlet.com&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;louis vuitton bags outlet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the map.

      <body-html>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Coach began as Manhattan Leather Bags in 1941, they were
inspired by baseball glove design and they created discount
handbags with similar qualities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.uk-supra.com&quot;&gt;supra shoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; didn't come
along until years later. The original handbag collection had twelve
designs, and they were made from supple, tan, top-quality leathers,
and showed the same excellent craftsmanship and stitching that we
still expect today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coach hired a woman named Bonnie Cashin in 1962, and she brought
new looks to Coach bags. She used many new fabrics and organic
materials like jersey and wool. She created the brass hardware that
is symbolic of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.menstimberlandshoes.com&quot;&gt;timberland boots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
When Lew Frankfort came aboard in 1979, he brought Coach to the
next level, and they became a name known the world over. Affordable
luxury was not a concept that many people knew, but now they would.
Soon after Frankfort joined Coach, they came out with a catalog,
and opened their flagship store in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980's, Coach expanded and made innovations that brought
its brand relevance and strength. They designed watches starting in
1988, and also expanded their company to Tokyo. Japan still counts
among the leading purchasers of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=
&quot;http://www.allofcoach.com&quot;&gt;coach purses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Coach
heels. The manufacture of Coach shoes began in the mid 90's, and

      <body>If you are after a pair of great looking and style UGG boots to wear during the winter months, then you can not go far wrong with getting yourself a pair of the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; Tall&#8217;s. Even though these boots have been around for a few years now they are likely to grow in popularity now. This is because they were recently featured in Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s Favorite Things show.
The UGG Classic Crochet is a new addition to the popular Classic collection with its slouchy styling and colorful knit uppers (polyester and wool blend). A sheepskin footbed provides the extra comfort that UGG boot and &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;ugg classic crochet&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for. A light and flexible outsole paired with a new decorative label makes this boot perfect for spring. The Classic Crochet boot can be cuffed or styled any creative way to personalize your look. As with the UGG Classic Cardy boot, the Crochet can either be worn with jeans. Or you can wear them pushed down so that they have slouched feel and look to them. But it does not matter what they are worn with or they way in which they are worn they will still help you to make quite a statement about yourself. Today&#8217;s women have become fashion conscious. They are going to almost any extent to look good and attractive. It has become important to look good. In fact, it is one of the most important factors that will decide success in various areas of life. It can boost up your confidence level.
As mentioned earlier the &lt;a href=http://www.moncler-ugg.com&gt;uggs for cheap&lt;/a&gt;Crochet Tall boots are going to grow in popularity this season, just because Oprah Winfrey included them in her Favorite Things show. Not only does she like the boots styling and colors (black, sand, rum raisin). The reason they are one of her favorite things is because she says it feels like she is walking on a cloud when she wears them.</body>
