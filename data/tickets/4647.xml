  <original-body>Due to some corporate firewall difficulties I decided to go to my home Mac and install the plugin in a rails project and then just copy the plugin from the vendors/plugin folder to my (inside) corporate project.

Is there a special registration that needs to take place somehow for the plugin as rails doesn't seem to recognize the method yet.

How do you run the &quot;test&quot; function that is in the plugin directory?

BTW, I'm just following along in the Rails Up and Running book's examples to execute through this.</original-body>

      <body>My apologies.  This was the first time to this list.  I'll focus it on bug reports only in the future and have already reposted to the Google mailing list group.  I am curious however why acts_as_list and acts_as_tree aren't in the rails baseline.  Seems like a pretty standard feature for relationships in most database apps.</body>
