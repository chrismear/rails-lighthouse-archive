  <original-body>This ticket has been in the old trac, with a patch, since december 2007. No comments as to why it should not be committed. Sorry if it has already been addressed, but I couldn't find any matching tickets in this tracker.

http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8954

&quot;Setting the filename on an inline MIME part is useful in situations when it's desirable to include some files as inline parts (e.g. inline image, pdf etc): client MUA or webmail then presents the correct filename when the user wants to download the file. Currently, ActionMailer adds the filename parameter for attachments only (part.rb)...&quot;

Patch is attached to that ticket, and applies quite cleanly to edge rails:

patching file test/mail_service_test.rb
Hunk #1 succeeded at 135 (offset 10 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 769 (offset 57 lines).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 830 with fuzz 1 (offset 18 lines).
patching file test/fixtures/raw_email14
patching file lib/action_mailer/part.rb
Hunk #1 succeeded at 65 with fuzz 1 (offset -5 lines).

and all tests pass, including the new one.</original-body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
