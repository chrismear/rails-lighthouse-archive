  <original-body>I have a partial named &quot;_large_google_map_users.html.erb&quot; which made the rendering threw the error &quot;cant convert nil.to_sym&quot;-Error. 

After further inspection if found the reason for this was a regex in
/actionpack-2.3.0/lib/action_view/template.rb (238)

&gt; m = extensions.match(/^(\w+)?\.?(\w+)?\.?(\w+)?\.?/)

the extracted portion was used to do a locale.to_sym later in this source file where it ultimately failed. Of course i didn't intented to use that new feature of localizing partials at all.

So, i do not know of this is a bug or if it is my problem that my partial's just accidently matched that regex. 

After renaming the partial to _large_google_map_community.html.erb, the problem was solved for me. Took me some head-scratching though before i looked for the problem in the action pack source.

This part of `template.rb` is also completely rewritten in 2.3.1, could you please confirm the issue on Rails 2.3 RC2 (i.e. Rails Edge)?</body>

      <body>This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.

The resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help. If you can still reproduce this error on the 3-0-stable branch or on master, please reply with all of the information you have about it and add &quot;[state:open]&quot; to your comment. This will reopen the ticket for review. Likewise, if you feel that this is a very important feature for Rails to include, please reply with your explanation so we can consider it.

Thank you for all your contributions, and we hope you will understand this step to focus our efforts where they are most helpful.</body>
